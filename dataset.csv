Chinchu, we had supported you all this while, but after you saw how everyone cried and pleaded to at least try, I think you should put some effort at least. For a while, to see if you guys can go a few weeks without talking.

Friend (Priyanka): I know, I could have hid the fact that he was in Mysore
From you guys
But I told you, so that you could go check on him. You people said you will help him rt
Chinnu Chechi didn't even reply to his text
Anyways
I asked him to go back
Wanted to meet him once and tell that I will not be in touch with him now on
Told that to him on phone itself

","I swear I can do this, I will talk to him if you want to and I won’t tell anyone. But that is only if you guys are willing to put some effort to not talk to each other for at least a few weeks.

Friend (Priyanka): Hey Chinnu, a very happy birthday to you. May this year bring you fresh perspectives and opportunities. May it keep you healthy and mindful of all the happiness around you. We may not speak or meet too often, that’s just how life is once you get older. But know that we both have your back always, any time you need it. Keep having fun, that’s the most important thing in life.

","Chinchu, I understand I haven’t given you a treat, I should have given you one long ago. Let’s go out for dinner day after tomorrow.
But it really hurts when Chinnu keeps saying that I don’t treat. I have treated and gifted everyone except Rahul Ettan and you when I got into Cisco. And I did not skimp on any of those, I gave everyone good treats, my parents, Abhi, velliachans, velliammas, Abhi and Swati. For Arjun’s, yes, I haven’t given a formal treat. But he had treated everyone at Bangalore on our way to Pondi, I thought that would suffice. There also you were not there. I really want to give you a treat. So let’s do that. But tbh, I don’t like how Chinnu keeps saying I haven’t treated at all. And each time she says it, she does it with too much vigour. It really hurts.
Also, for Arjun’s, there is an engagement function. But that also you’ll miss🙈 So for all of that let’s go out.

Friend (Varun): That's fine. I mean we don't control what happens to us and when. 
You could have just told me, or asked me and I'd have told you where we stand. 
But it's cool, you let me know where you are right now and what you want to do. If you'd rather us not talk, that's also fine (will be a bit sad) but I respect that.

","I wanted to ask you, but somehow the conversation never came up. So then I wondered what the equation was. 
No no, I’d love for us to talk. We connected very well. Communication gap came in the way.
But the other guy and I are very close. We are planning on dating and seeing how it goes.

(which I still don't know/understand)

Meghana: We vibed really really well. Had mentioned to Manasa also about you. Even the call with you was extremely easy. Everything was great. Had deleted Hinge and everything.
But I didn’t know what our equation was. You did mention you were shy when it came to girls.
But meanwhile something happened. So remember I told you about the guy who almost dated my cousin. The guy and I got quite close after that. And I didn’t know what was happening between us(you and I) and I didn’t want to lead on because the other guy and I started getting close. 
But I still keep telling Manasa how well we had connected

I can’t be with someone who doesn’t understand me. In those ways I’m jealous of Chinchu and Mahesh. Mahesh is a little regressive in his thoughts, but they have so much understanding and are so mindful of what each other is feeling
As soon as she cries he is just so compassionate with her. And so understanding of the fact that she’s hurt. Between us everything’s purely competitive
I can’t imagine a day where you’ll understand me when I’m actually crying, because of genuine emotions and you’ll pull me close and say that it will be okay.

","I am sometimes. Not a lot. For example this fight. I strongly believe I wasn’t unreasonable. The last big fight was on Onam. I told you that I thought what Amma said was unnecessary. You immediately got irritated. Lost temper just like that.

There was no exaggeration there.
It’s not. You hadn’t agreed at about your temper first. That came later.
So it looked like you were putting the entire blame on me
That you only lose temper because I’m unreasonable
I have more examples. Every time I asked for more communication or calls you’d immediately call my clingy and what not. Our very first fight was also regarding that. You’d call for like 10 minutes every day while in the car, cut my calls while I was speaking. I said I needed more communication/ video calls and you called me clingy
