[7/1/21, 11:06:31 AM] Varun: Should have just said wrong chat no 😂
[7/1/21, 11:06:50 AM] Meghana: I also thought if that later, but my mind wasn’t working da😂
[7/1/21, 11:06:51 AM] Varun: Why justify soo much
[7/1/21, 11:07:04 AM] Varun: Or say phone fell on face 😂
[7/1/21, 11:07:05 AM] Varun: Best
[7/1/21, 11:07:08 AM] Meghana: I don’t know, this sticker looks too creepy for some reason 😂
[7/1/21, 11:07:18 AM] Meghana: Oh yeah, why did I not think of this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[7/1/21, 11:07:24 AM] Meghana: Shit, that was funny😂😂
[7/1/21, 11:07:30 AM] Meghana: It’s going to be my go to from now

[7/1/21, 11:08:21 AM] Varun: True 😂

[7/1/21, 3:46:25 PM] Varun: Yeah 🙈
[7/1/21, 3:46:32 PM] Varun: Explain?
[7/1/21, 3:48:27 PM] Meghana: Oh, I don’t know why I said friend, it was cousin. My age but.
So she had sent me this connection request on LinkedIn today
[7/1/21, 3:49:00 PM] Varun: And..
[7/1/21, 3:49:13 PM] Meghana: And as soon as I accepted here request a suggestion of this guy came up. And I couldn’t tell where, but I recognised him
[7/1/21, 3:49:30 PM] Meghana: Now I feel like the story is nothing 😂 but I’ll still say
[7/1/21, 3:49:39 PM] Varun: No no go on
[7/1/21, 3:50:36 PM] Meghana: So I sent a request, there were quite a few mutual connections, but that’s because he studied in the same college as my friends from 11th and 12th.
And then I realised it was hinge where I recognised him from
[7/1/21, 3:50:58 PM] Varun: Hahahhahahha 😂😂
[7/1/21, 3:51:02 PM] Meghana: When I had just joined we had matched , but hadn’t talked much n all
[7/1/21, 3:51:07 PM] Varun: Too good🙈
[7/1/21, 3:51:13 PM] Meghana: But I was still curious about how my cousin knew him
[7/1/21, 3:51:28 PM] Varun: Hinge to LinkedIn🙈
[7/1/21, 3:51:50 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂yeah

[7/1/21, 3:52:40 PM] Meghana: Yes😂😂

[7/1/21, 3:52:53 PM] Varun: Ayyo ok
[7/1/21, 3:52:58 PM] Varun: Not that bad also
[7/1/21, 3:53:05 PM] Meghana: Now I’m wondering why I got excited 🤔
[7/1/21, 3:53:35 PM] Meghana: And then she also told me she has been exploring these apps and has dated a lot of people in the past year 😂
[7/1/21, 3:53:47 PM] Varun: It's ok, getting excited for small things is nice🙈
[7/1/21, 3:54:22 PM] Varun: Oh.. something I've never managed to do
[7/1/21, 3:54:28 PM] Meghana: Yes, especially because it’s corona n all, and I don’t have much of a life, these things are important events😂

[7/1/21, 3:54:55 PM] Meghana: Usually ends with hey 😂😂not even 2 days
[7/1/21, 3:55:02 PM] Varun: Hahaha 😂
[7/1/21, 3:55:15 PM] Varun: I'll take it past hey 🙈 but yeah 3 days max
[7/1/21, 3:55:48 PM] Meghana: Aye, this is like 3 weeks now

[7/1/21, 9:42:46 PM] Meghana: But it’s like this series of steps. We are sort of by passing the procedure in place now at Cisco.
So a lot of configs to be done
[7/1/21, 9:43:49 PM] Meghana: We currently have a CI/CD pipeline for the orchestration n all. But this new project can’t use that as it will lead to some unnecessary dependencies
[7/2/21, 2:02:48 AM] Varun: Oohh fancy
[7/2/21, 2:03:01 AM] Varun: Also madam please don't use the roof as a slide 🙈

[7/2/21, 10:44:34 AM] Varun: I'll take the ones that are getting exhausted by the end of this year
[7/2/21, 10:44:56 AM] Meghana: So many leaves do you get each monthV
[7/2/21, 10:45:00 AM] Meghana: *?

[7/2/21, 10:47:22 AM] Varun: Privileged I can encash or carry forward (upto 60days I can keep in that bucket)
[7/2/21, 10:47:29 AM] Meghana: Oh yes, same here. But how come I don’t have so many leaves left😮

[7/3/21, 4:51:14 PM] Meghana: Oh wait, let me think🤔
But wait, for this I need some background information about her.

What else would be a good option🤔
[7/3/21, 4:52:02 PM] Meghana: Aye, this needs some thinking, you wait da😂
[7/3/21, 4:52:09 PM] Meghana: But tomorrow is the birthday no?
[7/3/21, 4:52:32 PM] Varun: I'll give her the gift later no issues
[7/3/21, 4:52:46 PM] Varun: Googling what a tote bag is .. wait
[7/3/21, 4:52:59 PM] Varun: Got it
[7/3/21, 4:53:07 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂this is cute
[7/3/21, 4:53:25 PM] Meghana: Oh, then I have time to think
[7/3/21, 4:53:43 PM] Varun: ETA? 🙈
[7/3/21, 4:54:10 PM] Varun: Ok wait one more important background info you need 😂
[7/3/21, 4:54:14 PM] Meghana: Tomorrow morning?👀

[7/3/21, 4:54:18 PM] Meghana: Tell tell
[7/3/21, 4:54:25 PM] Varun: She is the college ex.. the one I'm good friends with 😂

[7/3/21, 4:54:54 PM] Varun: Not exactly college
[7/3/21, 4:54:56 PM] Meghana: Oh, good you told this😂

[7/3/21, 4:55:04 PM] Varun: But you get the point
[7/3/21, 4:55:07 PM] Meghana: Aah yes, this I remember
[7/3/21, 4:55:16 PM] Varun: Overlap 😂
[7/3/21, 4:55:44 PM] Meghana: 😂😂
[7/3/21, 4:55:47 PM] Varun: Only of education years not girls
[7/3/21, 4:55:53 PM] Varun: Incase you were confused
[7/3/21, 4:56:05 PM] Varun: Can't date 2 people and all at the same time.. too much stress
[7/3/21, 4:56:21 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂oh God, that was funny
[7/3/21, 4:56:32 PM] Meghana: I did not think this😂😂
[7/3/21, 4:56:43 PM] Meghana: But wait, now I’m wondering why I did not think of it that way
[7/3/21, 4:56:52 PM] Varun: I was just being clear
[7/3/21, 4:57:04 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😵to remember all the lies itself seems like one big job
[7/3/21, 4:57:23 PM] Varun: Since you haven't met me, you might think I can date 2 people and all 🙈
[7/3/21, 4:57:40 PM] Varun: My digital impression is all I've got rn🙈
[7/3/21, 4:57:54 PM] Meghana: 😂😂 good you cleared this then
[7/3/21, 4:58:03 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂so far so good but
[7/3/21, 4:58:32 PM] Varun: Thanks thanks 🙈
[7/3/21, 4:58:36 PM] Varun: Validation++
[7/3/21, 5:00:09 PM] Meghana: 😂😂you seem like a really nice person. I don’t think I’d have thought you’d date two people at once😂
[7/3/21, 5:00:18 PM] Meghana: Unless it was an open relationship n all
[7/3/21, 5:00:33 PM] Meghana: Then I don’t know, because I’ve never really understood how those work😵
[7/3/21, 5:01:37 PM] Varun: Usually I'm very confident in things I do.. cause I know and understand them. When it comes to girls and relationships I am generally a bit shy idk why.. it's always hard to place and understand some emotions 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:02:46 PM] Meghana: I figured this🙈
Is it like the idea of a relationship that you shy away from?
[7/3/21, 5:03:34 PM] Varun: No no
[7/3/21, 5:03:43 PM] Varun: Just inexperience I guess
[7/3/21, 5:03:50 PM] Varun: It's a bit of an unknown no
[7/3/21, 5:04:37 PM] Meghana: Aye, you’ve had two long enough relationships no😮
[7/3/21, 5:04:42 PM] Meghana: That’s there🤔
[7/3/21, 5:04:45 PM] Varun: See you take something like sports , I can practice every day play more and more game.. how to do that in a relationship 🙈 daily New relationship is a little hard no
[7/3/21, 5:04:58 PM] Varun: Every person is unique no
[7/3/21, 5:05:35 PM] Varun: If I make a mistake today I'll fix and come back tomorrow. In a relationship that may not happen.. might not be a tomorrow to come back to no
[7/3/21, 5:05:45 PM] Varun: Ooof.. too deep too deep
[7/3/21, 5:05:58 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂daily new relationship it seems.
I don’t know who does this😂 why not work on the same one instead da?😂
[7/3/21, 5:05:58 PM] Varun: Let's move on to lighter topics 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:06:16 PM] Meghana: Yes😮😮 shit, that was deep
[7/3/21, 5:06:25 PM] Meghana: But there could be a tomorrow
[7/3/21, 5:06:30 PM] Meghana: Just with a different person
[7/3/21, 5:06:33 PM] Varun: I do , I mean I will.
[7/3/21, 5:06:37 PM] Varun: Always 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:06:39 PM] Meghana: So there is room for correction for sure
[7/3/21, 5:07:15 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂but we only tangentially touched this
[7/3/21, 5:07:42 PM] Varun: Tangent to full blown perpendicular doesn't take time 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:07:59 PM] Varun: But if you want to continue to talk about this , I don't mind 😌
[7/3/21, 5:10:11 PM] Meghana: Ahha, I’m  trying to understand the metaphor here
[7/3/21, 5:10:33 PM] Varun: Too geometric no 😂
[7/3/21, 5:10:50 PM] Meghana: 😂😂the geometry I understood, but that was about it
[7/3/21, 5:10:52 PM] Varun: So if you drop a perpendicular to a tangent it passes through the center of the circle
[7/3/21, 5:11:38 PM] Varun: Tangentially touching to perpendicular ie just scratching to going right into the middle of the circle
[7/3/21, 5:11:45 PM] Varun: That's what I was going for 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:13:37 PM] Varun: Leave it
[7/3/21, 5:13:45 PM] Varun: It was a little lame only 😂😂
[7/3/21, 5:13:55 PM] Varun: Too nerdy
[7/3/21, 5:14:22 PM] Meghana: It was going above my head da😂
I tried re reading n all. But the time is not right. I’ll read this again in the morning. 
The math I understood though😂
[7/3/21, 5:14:48 PM] Varun: It's ok. 😂😂
[7/3/21, 5:15:04 PM] Varun: I think I'm sleepy , I'll attempt to sleep
[7/3/21, 5:15:12 PM] Varun: I'll text if I don't fall asleep
[7/3/21, 5:15:22 PM] Meghana: 😂😂
[7/3/21, 5:15:29 PM] Varun: I've to be up at 9 :(
[7/3/21, 5:15:35 PM] Varun: I don't like that on a Sunday
[7/3/21, 5:15:44 PM] Meghana: Yes, I think I’ll be awake. No sleep since the past two days😭
[7/3/21, 5:15:47 PM] Meghana: Why?😮
[7/3/21, 5:15:52 PM] Varun: Some apartment meeting is there
[7/3/21, 5:16:00 PM] Varun: I've to go help them out
[7/3/21, 5:16:45 PM] Meghana: Oh😮shit, 9 sounds too early. Especially because it’s almost 3 and you are still awake😮
[7/3/21, 5:17:31 PM] Varun: Yaa
[7/3/21, 5:17:37 PM] Varun: I shall try to quick nap

[7/7/21, 8:10:47 AM] Meghana: Just got done. Today was crazy😵
[7/7/21, 8:11:15 AM] Meghana: So there is this tonsillectomy procedure that I’ve been putting off for months
[7/7/21, 8:11:43 AM] Meghana: But then I thought I should just be done with it, because it scares me
[7/7/21, 8:11:48 AM] Meghana: Face the fear😂
[7/7/21, 8:12:02 AM] Meghana: So I asked my PM when he thought would be a good time for me to do it
[7/7/21, 8:12:05 AM] Meghana: Because of work stuff
[7/7/21, 8:12:26 AM] Meghana: He suggested I finish it before the ResHat calls resume
[7/7/21, 8:12:40 AM] Meghana: I had actually thought of getting the procedure done after my GRE next week
[7/7/21, 8:12:55 AM] Meghana: But the RedHat engagement will start again on 21st
[7/7/21, 8:13:07 AM] Meghana: So I went to my doctor at Apollo in the morning
[7/7/21, 8:13:21 AM] Meghana: Long story short, I’m getting the surgery done on Saturday 😂😵

[7/8/21, 1:58:31 AM] Meghana: Yeah, because 18 n all no. My 23 feels less important 😂

[7/8/21, 6:01:50 AM] Varun: Little

[7/9/21, 12:45:04 PM] Meghana: Mostly at 7:30
[7/9/21, 12:45:30 PM] Meghana: The whole procedure will take around 4 hours I think. Surgery itself may be only like 1 hour
[7/9/21, 12:45:46 PM] Meghana: But the pre prep and post surgery n all will take some time it seems
[7/9/21, 1:06:28 PM] Varun: Mostly?
[7/9/21, 1:13:07 PM] Meghana: If people with emergencies suddenly come in they might have to postpone mine, but otherwise mine will be the first is what they told me

[7/9/21, 8:09:18 PM] Varun: Once wrist also. But that was only bone bruise
[7/9/21, 8:09:20 PM] Varun: Nothing broke
[7/9/21, 8:09:29 PM] Meghana: Damn😵😵
[7/9/21, 8:09:38 PM] Varun: Forearm was a bad scene
[7/9/21, 8:09:47 PM] Varun: Hand shape only changed
[7/9/21, 8:09:50 PM] Meghana: How did it happen?

[7/9/21, 8:10:44 PM] Varun: Right
[7/9/21, 8:11:06 PM] Meghana: Ayyo😵😵
Shit, that’s a lot for a 1st standard kid. 😵
[7/9/21, 8:11:12 PM] Varun: That's when I learnt to write with my left hand
[7/9/21, 8:11:24 PM] Varun: Fun times 😂
[7/9/21, 8:11:37 PM] Meghana: Oh😮😂well, it was useful in some ways then
[7/9/21, 8:11:44 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂fun times it seems
[7/9/21, 8:12:03 PM] Meghana: I have never really had injuries as such, touchwood
[7/9/21, 8:12:09 PM] Varun: I've troubled my parents a lot 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:12:12 PM] Meghana: But my sister used to keep getting stitches
[7/9/21, 8:12:22 PM] Varun: That also I've got 😂
[7/9/21, 8:12:28 PM] Varun: On my chin
[7/9/21, 8:12:39 PM] Meghana: I see that😂😂

[7/9/21, 8:13:12 PM] Meghana: When was your last injury?
[7/9/21, 8:13:28 PM] Meghana: I hope the occurrences reduced as you grew up
[7/9/21, 8:13:38 PM] Varun: Haha 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:13:50 PM] Varun: Last I think was football
[7/9/21, 8:13:55 PM] Meghana: For real 😂
[7/9/21, 8:14:00 PM] Varun: I sprained my wrist
[7/9/21, 8:14:11 PM] Meghana: Oh damn. When was this?
[7/9/21, 8:14:13 PM] Varun: I had to skip one game
[7/9/21, 8:14:28 PM] Varun: December ish
[7/9/21, 8:14:46 PM] Meghana: That’s very very recent 😂😂
I thought you’d say some two years back n all😂
[7/9/21, 8:14:49 PM] Varun: Oh no wait wait
[7/9/21, 8:15:01 PM] Varun: I fully fucked my thumb in March
[7/9/21, 8:15:03 PM] Varun: Cricket
[7/9/21, 8:15:24 PM] Meghana: Oh shit, must have been really hurtful.

[7/9/21, 8:15:31 PM] Varun: It became swollen and purple. 😂
[7/9/21, 8:15:37 PM] Varun: One brinjal it became
[7/9/21, 8:15:44 PM] Meghana: March was like a month ago it feels like
[7/9/21, 8:15:46 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:15:46 PM] Varun: Yeah with keeping
[7/9/21, 8:15:52 PM] Meghana: Ayyo😮

[7/9/21, 8:16:23 PM] Varun: 10 days
[7/9/21, 8:16:23 PM] Meghana: Shit, I can’t even imagine that pain
[7/9/21, 8:16:34 PM] Meghana: For small things only thumb chumma hurts sometimes
[7/9/21, 8:16:40 PM] Meghana: So this😵😵
[7/9/21, 8:16:40 PM] Varun: I think at this point I'm just used to it
[7/9/21, 8:17:10 PM] Meghana: 😂😂that’s okay too I guess
Hope you don’t have another injury or sprain or fracture.
[7/9/21, 8:17:25 PM] Varun: Thanks 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:17:27 PM] Varun: I'll try
[7/9/21, 8:17:36 PM] Varun: Have you met your surgeon?
[7/9/21, 8:17:50 PM] Meghana: Not today. I don’t think he’s here yet.🤔
[7/9/21, 8:17:58 PM] Meghana: At 7:30 they’ll take me it seems
[7/9/21, 8:18:08 PM] Meghana: The nurse just came and told
[7/9/21, 8:18:20 PM] Meghana: Don’t know when I’ll be able to meet the surgeon
[7/9/21, 8:18:27 PM] Meghana: I actually had first met a doctor at Bangalore
[7/9/21, 8:18:30 PM] Meghana: Some time ago
[7/9/21, 8:18:35 PM] Meghana: I wanted to get it done by her
[7/9/21, 8:18:49 PM] Varun: Oh
[7/9/21, 8:18:49 PM] Meghana: Then because of the logistics she referred me to him since he’s here only
[7/9/21, 8:18:51 PM] Varun: But this is good
[7/9/21, 8:18:59 PM] Varun: Your parents are there with you
[7/9/21, 8:19:05 PM] Varun: They will also be at peace
[7/9/21, 8:19:31 PM] Meghana: Parents are not giving me peace 😂
Dad went home last night because Abhi is alone at home. Mom stayed with me
[7/9/21, 8:20:03 PM] Meghana: Yeah, now they are I think
[7/9/21, 8:20:14 PM] Meghana: They keep asking me if I’m worried
[7/9/21, 8:20:18 PM] Meghana: And then I told them
[7/9/21, 8:20:34 PM] Varun: Paavam
[7/9/21, 8:20:36 PM] Varun: Let them be
[7/9/21, 8:20:39 PM] Meghana: That I’m very bold n all😂
And I usually smile a lot, so they know I’m okay
[7/9/21, 8:20:50 PM] Varun: I don't think we'll ever understand unless we are in their place
[7/9/21, 8:21:19 PM] Meghana: True, this I also thought . But this is a lot of worrying no😵
But I guess this sort of naturally comes
[7/9/21, 8:21:37 PM] Meghana: No matter how much we say we won’t be like them
[7/9/21, 8:21:49 PM] Meghana: I keep asking parents to be very selfish and think more about themselves
[7/9/21, 8:21:58 PM] Meghana: But they don’t 😑
[7/9/21, 8:22:10 PM] Varun: Generation gap 😂
[7/9/21, 8:22:17 PM] Meghana: I tell them also that they don’t have to feel guilty about this because I’m going to do this to my kids😂
[7/9/21, 8:22:38 PM] Meghana: Big one😂😂
But I’m sure we will all be like this eventually
[7/9/21, 8:22:46 PM] Meghana: When the time comes
[7/9/21, 8:23:00 PM] Meghana: But you know what I won’t like
[7/9/21, 8:23:14 PM] Meghana: My kids dating, I think I’ll get annoyed and possessive 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:23:19 PM] Meghana: Especially if it’s a son
[7/9/21, 8:23:22 PM] Meghana: 😪😪😪😭😭
[7/9/21, 8:23:43 PM] Varun: I mean I will be a different parent to my child for sure. But that's not cause what my mom and dad is was wrong of anything.. just a different approach
[7/9/21, 8:24:00 PM] Varun: 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:24:33 PM] Varun: This is going to be fun to watch 😂
[7/9/21, 8:24:36 PM] Meghana: Yeah, that yes, I keep telling parents also this all the time. But the worrying will always be there I guess
[7/9/21, 8:24:45 PM] Meghana: 😭😭it’s going to be very hurtful
[7/9/21, 8:25:01 PM] Meghana: I’m sure they’ll come home one day saying they’ve found one bitch😪
[7/9/21, 8:25:20 PM] Varun: Already soo judgemental 😂
[7/9/21, 8:25:30 PM] Varun: Give the girl a chance no 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:25:37 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂yes🤭
[7/9/21, 8:26:01 PM] Meghana: She has to be really good😪😪
I’ll think about this. But I just hope they don’t find anyone too soon
[7/9/21, 8:26:05 PM] Meghana: I feel really evil😂
[7/9/21, 8:26:10 PM] Meghana: But it’s okay🤭
[7/9/21, 8:26:26 PM] Meghana: I think if it’s a daughter she can date🤔
[7/9/21, 8:26:55 PM] Varun: Think about it like you are the girl and your boyfriend's mother doesn't give you a chance 😂
[7/9/21, 8:27:00 PM] Varun: Then you'll understand
[7/9/21, 8:27:10 PM] Meghana: 😮😮😮😮😮
[7/9/21, 8:27:16 PM] Varun: Why this gender bias
[7/9/21, 8:28:12 PM] Meghana: Oh damn, no no no no😮😮 that will be horrible . Shit.
But yes, I think I’ll also eventually come around, but it will be hard to accept initially 😪😪😪or maybe I’ll just gel with her really well
[7/9/21, 8:28:19 PM] Meghana: I don’t understand either😂😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:29:02 PM] Varun: In sure you'll eventually come around. It's just the initial emotion 😂
[7/9/21, 8:29:05 PM] Varun: Im *
[7/9/21, 8:29:45 PM] Meghana: Yes, I think after some time I’ll just get used to the fact. Until then I’ll just eat up my sorrow😪
[7/9/21, 8:30:25 PM] Varun: Eat up my sorrow itseems 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:30:34 PM] Varun: Go rant to your husband
[7/9/21, 8:30:39 PM] Meghana: Then what😪
[7/9/21, 8:30:44 PM] Meghana: He better sit and listen😂
[7/9/21, 8:30:57 PM] Varun: I guess by that point he'll be good at it
[7/9/21, 8:30:59 PM] Varun: 😂
[7/9/21, 8:31:20 PM] Meghana: Yes yes, he’ll be used to it by then😂 but I won’t do that annoying rant I think
[7/9/21, 8:31:28 PM] Meghana: He better find it cute, else I’m dead😂
[7/9/21, 8:31:35 PM] Varun: Hahaha 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:32:17 PM] Varun: Do you switch language with you are really angry?
[7/9/21, 8:33:20 PM] Meghana: I do I do. Anything that affects me I speak about in English. As in at home, if I get emotional or if I’m angry I switch to English
[7/9/21, 8:33:27 PM] Meghana: You do too?
[7/9/21, 8:33:47 PM] Meghana: I usually speak in malayalam only to parents
[7/9/21, 8:34:29 PM] Varun: Depends who I'm angry with
[7/9/21, 8:34:42 PM] Varun: Yeah I speak in tamil only to mom and dad
[7/9/21, 8:34:51 PM] Meghana: 😂😂what are the different languages you switch to?
[7/9/21, 8:35:01 PM] Varun: If I'm angry with them one unique mixture is tamil and English will come
[7/9/21, 8:35:34 PM] Varun: Otherwise anger usually results in English
[7/9/21, 8:35:37 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂this sounds fun and really cute
Only when angry or any kind of emotional state?
[7/9/21, 8:35:49 PM] Varun: Now my parents will get up and yell at me for being up. So I'm going to close my eyes, if I sleep I'll sleep or else ill wake up in 30mins and pretend I woke up early 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:35:58 PM] Varun: Any heightened emotion
[7/9/21, 8:36:17 PM] Meghana: 😂😂awww

[7/27/21, 3:47:29 AM] Meghana: It’s a wonderful logic. I try to be like this as well. But it’s hard to keep it that way
[7/27/21, 3:47:32 AM] Varun: If people don't expect from you.. everything is considered good 😂
[7/27/21, 3:47:59 AM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂
So you like put down expectations fully ?
[7/27/21, 3:52:20 AM] Varun: Generally keep expectations low 🙈
[7/27/21, 3:52:30 AM] Varun: But always give 100%
[7/27/21, 5:26:05 AM] Meghana: Yeah?😮
[7/27/21, 5:26:32 AM] Meghana: Doing that is not easy😮
[7/27/21, 5:33:08 AM] Varun: You've to try no. If you don't try then you have only yourself to blame
[7/27/21, 5:54:46 AM] Meghana: Aah yes yes, I try n all
But to keep 0 expectations and give that much is hard right? 
As in, if that isn’t reciprocated even a little bit it’s hard right?
[7/27/21, 6:13:09 AM] Varun: Hmm.. I expect a lot of myself
[7/27/21, 6:13:18 AM] Varun: I make sure others don't expect too much
[7/27/21, 6:13:34 AM] Varun: So disappointment is limited to me 😂
[7/27/21, 6:17:56 AM] Meghana: From you?
[7/27/21, 6:18:09 AM] Meghana: For other people right?
[7/27/21, 6:37:54 AM] Varun: This requires more explanation. 😂
[7/27/21, 6:38:20 AM] Meghana: My cousin is calling me for shopping😟I’m trying to fight my temptation now
[7/27/21, 6:38:31 AM] Meghana: Yes😂😂
[7/27/21, 6:39:04 AM] Varun: I make sure others don't expect much of me so whatever I do they aren't disappointed.
But I expect a lot out of myself so I'm almost always disappointed (not good , but sometimes motivating)
[7/27/21, 6:55:58 AM] Meghana: Oh yeah, I actually can totally relate to the second part.
What are you expectations from yourself?
[7/27/21, 7:51:14 AM] Varun: Depends on what thing no? 😂

[8/8/21, 2:00:06 AM] Varun: Left at 7
[8/8/21, 2:00:23 AM] Varun: I'll reach home before 2 😌
[8/8/21, 4:29:26 AM] Varun: Just got home
[8/8/21, 4:29:35 AM] Varun: (exactly before 2) 😂
[8/8/21, 6:01:27 AM] Meghana: Yes yes🤭
[8/8/21, 6:01:33 AM] Meghana: I just got home
[8/8/21, 6:01:37 AM] Meghana: Yayy😂
[8/8/21, 6:01:50 AM] Meghana: I drove today
[8/8/21, 6:48:19 AM] Varun: Omg how was it? 🙈
[8/8/21, 7:39:53 AM] Meghana: Was amazing 🤩
But didn’t like my dj😪
[8/8/21, 2:07:27 PM] Varun: Oh no why
[8/8/21, 2:07:34 PM] Varun: Dude I slept off
[8/8/21, 2:07:37 PM] Varun: I woke up now
[8/18/21, 8:41:53 AM] Varun: Hihi! I've just become the hinge boy you used to talk to now 🙈
[8/19/21, 10:29:58 AM] Meghana: Hey hey
[8/19/21, 10:30:15 AM] Meghana: the only hinge boy I used to talk to actually 👀
[8/19/21, 10:36:00 AM] Varun: And then stopped for some reason 🙈
[8/19/21, 10:36:19 AM] Varun: (which I still don't know/understand)
[8/19/21, 2:51:00 PM] Meghana: We vibed really really well. Had mentioned to Manasa also about you. Even the call with you was extremely easy. Everything was great. Had deleted Hinge and everything.
But I didn’t know what our equation was. You did mention you were shy when it came to girls.
But meanwhile something happened. So remember I told you about the guy who almost dated my cousin. The guy and I got quite close after that. And I didn’t know what was happening between us(you and I) and I didn’t want to lead on because the other guy and I started getting close. 
But I still keep telling Manasa how well we had connected
[8/19/21, 2:51:16 PM] Meghana: 😢😢
[8/19/21, 3:06:43 PM] Varun: That's fine. I mean we don't control what happens to us and when. 
You could have just told me, or asked me and I'd have told you where we stand. 
But it's cool, you let me know where you are right now and what you want to do. If you'd rather us not talk, that's also fine (will be a bit sad) but I respect that.
[8/19/21, 3:17:52 PM] Meghana: I wanted to ask you, but somehow the conversation never came up. So then I wondered what the equation was. 
No no, I’d love for us to talk. We connected very well. Communication gap came in the way.
But the other guy and I are very close. We are planning on dating and seeing how it goes.
[8/19/21, 4:09:51 PM] Varun: Understandable. I was just taking my time, given that you are back in Mysore and I'm here. But I'm glad you told me. ✌️
[8/19/21, 11:19:56 PM] Meghana: Yes, that I understand now. Shit. But since nothing on those lines came up in our conversations (my bad too, I should have brought it up) I thought it wasn’t happening.
So we won’t talk at all?
[8/20/21, 1:38:24 AM] Varun: That's alright.
[8/20/21, 1:38:41 AM] Varun: Ayy no, I'd really like to still talk to you, if you are ok with it ofc
[8/20/21, 3:00:38 PM] Meghana: Yes yes, I’d love it too🤩
I’d really love for us to still talk
[8/20/21, 3:30:07 PM] Varun: 😌
[8/20/21, 3:30:09 PM] Varun: Sure ✌️
[8/21/21, 4:22:51 AM] Varun: Happy onam da!
[8/21/21, 5:44:57 AM] Meghana: Thank you so much 🙈
And same to you da
[8/21/21, 5:45:19 AM] Meghana: Put a very big flower rangoli this time
[8/21/21, 9:18:12 AM] Varun: I went to grandmoms house and ate and slept 😂
[8/22/21, 12:55:08 AM] Meghana: 😂😂sadhya?
[8/22/21, 12:59:58 AM] Meghana: Even I ate too much 😮😮
[8/22/21, 1:00:05 AM] Meghana: Couldn’t move 😵
[8/22/21, 1:00:40 AM] Varun: Haha I took a solid 4 hr nap
[8/22/21, 3:14:31 AM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
[8/22/21, 3:14:41 AM] Meghana: That was the best thing to do the
[8/22/21, 3:14:43 AM] Meghana: *tbh
[8/22/21, 3:14:52 AM] Meghana: We tried watching a movie and all of us fell asleep
[8/22/21, 3:14:57 AM] Meghana: Then rewatched at night
[8/22/21, 3:29:19 AM] Varun: Haha, I was up a long while cause of that afternoon nap
