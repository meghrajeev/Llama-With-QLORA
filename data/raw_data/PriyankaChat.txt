[4/29/20, 2:31:00 PM] Meghana: Can’t even check with different epochs 😓
[4/29/20, 2:32:08 PM] Priyanka: How do you decide on the number?
[4/29/20, 2:34:27 PM] Meghana: I don’t know for sure how many epochs I need to run
[4/29/20, 2:34:55 PM] Meghana: Had seen a couple of notebooks where people ran around 30 n all
[4/29/20, 2:35:19 PM] Priyanka: You should have tried 25
[4/29/20, 2:35:29 PM] Priyanka: What's the accuracy for 29th

[5/11/20, 1:10:14 PM] Meghana: What are you saying 🤦🏾‍♀️
It’s okay,no problem🤦🏾‍♀️
What we have to do now is get everyone to be happy about it no..
[5/11/20, 1:10:24 PM] Meghana: For a long time he was shocked
[5/11/20, 1:10:52 PM] Meghana: Now he’s mainly just worried about how his family is n all
[5/11/20, 1:11:21 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/11/20, 1:12:57 PM] Meghana: And also I was telling no,that they have something against Telegites for some reason
[5/11/20, 1:13:17 PM] Meghana: But they seem to be okay with that now
[5/11/20, 1:13:48 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/11/20, 1:14:04 PM] Priyanka: I know this is not going to be easy
[5/11/20, 1:14:23 PM] Priyanka: I have to be ready for it

[5/11/20, 1:15:13 PM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/11/20, 1:15:34 PM] Meghana: Or maybe by then they might just accept it and be okay with it
[5/11/20, 1:16:23 PM] Priyanka: Hmm.. I feel Velliachan understands me
[5/11/20, 1:16:38 PM] Priyanka: And he has got velliama to understand
[5/11/20, 1:19:50 PM] Meghana: But they are really upset..until yesterday actually I hadn’t realised ..velliamma teared up..velliachan also was telling that he is very disturbed...they were telling that they are only trying to be okay with it because they don’t have another choice...
Like they are really upset..
But this was expected no...when they meet him their opinion will change..he is a really nice guy
[5/11/20, 1:20:34 PM] Meghana: They’ll also understand that and actually come to terms with it,like for real
[5/11/20, 1:20:48 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/11/20, 1:20:52 PM] Meghana: This lockdown 🤦🏾‍♀️

[5/11/20, 1:20:58 PM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/11/20, 1:21:13 PM] Priyanka: He is ready to talk to Velliachan
[5/11/20, 1:21:26 PM] Priyanka: I asked him to wait
[5/11/20, 1:22:28 PM] Meghana: Maybe a couple of months more🤔
But he should speak to velliachan..
Velliachan was saying that he won’t make the first move and wants him to talk to him first
[5/11/20, 1:22:56 PM] Priyanka: Hmm.. I know
[5/11/20, 1:23:41 PM] Meghana: After the lockdown ends,they should probably meet once

[5/16/20, 1:50:14 AM] Meghana: They will get over it ...they haven’t lost their affection towards you n all ...dad was saying “She won’t have a problem ,even if she can’t get along with his family...we are all there for her no,and he is there”
[5/16/20, 1:50:32 AM] Meghana: It will just take some time to digest the fact
[5/16/20, 1:50:46 AM] Priyanka: 🙈 that's enough for me to feel better
[5/16/20, 1:50:51 AM] Priyanka: Thanks Meghu
[5/16/20, 1:51:49 AM] Meghana: Once velliachan and velliamma speak to him and they get to know that he is a nice guy and when they tell that to parents they will be on board with the whole idea”
[5/16/20, 1:51:58 AM] Priyanka: Ya

[5/16/20, 1:53:04 AM] Priyanka: 2
[5/16/20, 1:53:17 AM] Meghana: I also thought you might be down

[5/16/20, 1:53:42 AM] Priyanka: Hmm.. I don't have the right to say anything
[5/16/20, 1:53:53 AM] Priyanka: I know I have hurt people
[5/16/20, 1:54:58 AM] Meghana: They are hurt only because they don’t want to see you struggle .... finally your happiness is their happiness...
After the wedding when they see you happy they will forget all this
[5/16/20, 1:55:13 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/16/20, 1:55:38 AM] Meghana: The only thing that worries them is whether you can adjust to all of it..
[5/16/20, 1:56:30 AM] Priyanka: Hmm.. I am also not a hundred percent sure if I can adjust.. but I know I will try my best
[5/16/20, 1:56:47 AM] Meghana: It will be very difficult
[5/16/20, 1:56:51 AM] Priyanka: That too.. is a matter of time
[5/16/20, 1:57:47 AM] Meghana: Yes, maybe after a couple of years everything will fall into the grove
[5/16/20, 1:57:53 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/16/20, 1:58:19 AM] Meghana: If only they were settled somewhere here only,like in Mysore and Bangalore 😭
[5/16/20, 1:59:03 AM] Priyanka: 😅 thank God I didn't fall for a north Indian.. what would you say then
[5/16/20, 1:59:15 AM] Meghana: 😂😂😂

[5/17/20, 2:11:26 PM] Priyanka: Patni 😅
[5/17/20, 2:11:50 PM] Meghana: Patni🤔? Whose?🤔
[5/17/20, 2:12:07 PM] Priyanka: Pattini.. hunger in malayalam
[5/17/20, 2:12:36 PM] Meghana: Oh😂😂😂angane
[5/17/20, 2:12:45 PM] Meghana: Nallatha😂😂in a way😂
[5/17/20, 2:12:51 PM] Priyanka: 😂
[5/17/20, 2:13:56 PM] Priyanka: Do something impromptu
[5/17/20, 2:14:02 PM] Priyanka: Like this
[5/19/20, 2:10:16 PM] Meghana: What’s happening 🤦🏾‍♀️
[5/19/20, 2:16:39 PM] Priyanka: What did she tell you
[5/19/20, 2:24:49 PM] Meghana: I know she was kind of rude when she said all that and should have considered that you were alone...
[5/19/20, 2:27:27 PM] Meghana: But why are you both fighting like this🤦🏾‍♀️
You guys need to sit and talk
[5/19/20, 2:27:58 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/19/20, 2:28:29 PM] Meghana: I understand he was angry , but she was just putting across what was happening at home
[5/19/20, 2:31:25 PM] Meghana: Both you and Chinnu are equally frustrated
[5/19/20, 2:31:44 PM] Meghana: That’s why
[5/19/20, 2:58:53 PM] Priyanka: Ya.. chinnu chechi sent me a recording of what velliama.. I cried badly.. who else do I share the pain with?
[5/19/20, 3:00:40 PM] Priyanka: I never put her in bad light. He thought why can't she understand I'm alone here.  He sent the message without me knowing. I then made him understand that she gets to hear what mom and dad talk everyday
[5/19/20, 3:00:59 PM] Priyanka: *velliama said
[5/19/20, 3:01:23 PM] Priyanka: Did she tell you anything more
[5/19/20, 3:01:34 PM] Priyanka: These two have low tempers
[5/19/20, 3:01:45 PM] Priyanka: I'm not frustrated. Just sad.
[5/19/20, 3:15:45 PM] Meghana: Yes, I understand that..obviously you need to talk about what you feel to someone..it’s totally understandable that you spoke to him about it...
But everything that she is saying, aarayalum paranju pokunna karyangal aanu... 
And yes, knowing what exactly is happening here is not any easier for you either... but someone has got to tell you what exactly is happening here as well right... and you have always known that all this would happen.. it hasn’t come as a shock... 
crying about it won’t solve it... you will have to hear a lot more when you come back too... but vishamichu irunnu happiness okke kalayunnathil what’s the point
[5/19/20, 3:16:07 PM] Meghana: She was crying
[5/19/20, 3:16:50 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/19/20, 3:18:19 PM] Meghana: You have to try and be bold unless you have plans to let him go... and that won’t happen, so the only option here is to be bold
[5/19/20, 3:18:29 PM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/19/20, 3:18:51 PM] Priyanka: I am torn between two thoughts
[5/19/20, 3:19:07 PM] Priyanka: Never wanted to hurt my parents
[5/19/20, 3:19:29 PM] Meghana: Giving up on people is not easy
[5/19/20, 3:20:42 PM] Meghana: Now it’s too late anyway.. but to be totally honest,you could have put some effort before itself 🤔
[5/19/20, 3:21:24 PM] Meghana: That’s how the system works 😭 it’s not your fault..
[5/19/20, 3:21:31 PM] Priyanka: I didn't want to give him up then, not now
[5/19/20, 3:21:51 PM] Priyanka: I wanted everyone to accept him and be happy. But that's a dream
[5/19/20, 3:22:16 PM] Priyanka: I have to face it. I'm ok with that. Crying is a way of coping
[5/19/20, 3:22:29 PM] Priyanka: I'll try being bolder
[5/19/20, 3:23:15 PM] Priyanka: I'm not blaming chinnu chechi of anything. I totally get her
[5/19/20, 3:23:55 PM] Meghana: That’s where priorities come into picture Chinchu...
That’s why they are also sad... that you didn’t put any effort
But nobody can be blamed here... for how long can people tame their hearts
[5/19/20, 3:25:00 PM] Meghana: You should probably get used to it also😂
[5/19/20, 3:25:09 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/19/20, 3:25:16 PM] Meghana: Point is, just try and be bolder
[5/19/20, 3:25:22 PM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/19/20, 3:26:51 PM] Priyanka: I thought maybe distance from him will give me clarity. And it did. I'm sure about him.
I know families are very different. We will do our best to work all of it out.
[5/19/20, 3:26:55 PM] Meghana: She fights like crazy with everyone here when they scold you also... it works both ways
[5/19/20, 3:27:10 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/19/20, 3:27:16 PM] Priyanka: I know
[5/19/20, 3:28:05 PM] Meghana: How’s the project thing going?
[5/19/20, 3:28:25 PM] Priyanka: Didn't do anything today. Let me get back to work
[5/19/20, 3:29:03 PM] Meghana: Yes,For now leave all this aside, don’t think about it
[5/19/20, 3:29:15 PM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/19/20, 3:29:20 PM] Meghana: Things will hopefully get better
[5/19/20, 3:29:23 PM] Priyanka: You go to sleep
[5/19/20, 3:29:26 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[5/19/20, 3:29:32 PM] Meghana: Yes
[5/19/20, 3:30:06 PM] Meghana: And if you’re trying to look for a job, give that your all.. all this was expected, try not to be upset
[5/19/20, 3:30:21 PM] Priyanka: Doing that
[5/19/20, 3:30:39 PM] Meghana: Have a good day then, I’ll also go sleep
[5/19/20, 3:30:41 PM] Meghana: Buhbye

[5/20/20, 2:27:26 AM] Meghana: Had a college presentation and sync up meeting at office..that’s why it got late
[5/20/20, 2:27:29 AM] Meghana: You slept?
[5/20/20, 10:38:35 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[5/20/20, 10:38:59 AM] Priyanka: You called me when I was in deep sleep. I did you a theri 😅

[1/5/21, 1:52:43 AM] Priyanka: Mom scolded me for hiding everything in the beginning
[1/5/21, 1:52:59 AM] Meghana: But you told them in September itself right?
[1/5/21, 1:53:09 AM] Meghana: Like a month after you left
[1/5/21, 1:53:20 AM] Priyanka: Ya, but not that I was seeing him when I was at sap
[1/5/21, 1:53:58 AM] Meghana: Tell them that nothing was sure then, he came to see off, that’s all...things started later
[1/5/21, 1:54:15 AM] Meghana: Stand by what you said yesterday only
[1/5/21, 1:54:21 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[1/5/21, 1:54:31 AM] Meghana: That he just came, that’s all

[1/5/21, 1:55:16 AM] Meghana: How are you feeling today?
[1/5/21, 1:55:21 AM] Priyanka: I don't know Meghu how to get through this
[1/5/21, 1:55:31 AM] Priyanka: Mostly worried for him
[1/5/21, 1:55:36 AM] Priyanka: He is in Mysore
[1/5/21, 1:55:42 AM] Priyanka: I didn't go to meet
[1/5/21, 1:55:58 AM] Priyanka: He wanted to come home and talk to Velliachan
[1/5/21, 1:56:06 AM] Meghana: Oh shit, is he coming home? He can come home and talk then no?
[1/5/21, 1:56:15 AM] Priyanka: Velliachan said whatever he wanted on phone only
[1/5/21, 1:56:26 AM] Meghana: Oh😮
[1/5/21, 1:56:44 AM] Meghana: Maybe they can talk in person and velliachan can make him understand
[1/5/21, 1:56:48 AM] Meghana: ?
[1/5/21, 1:56:53 AM] Meghana: How’s he holding up?
[1/5/21, 1:57:04 AM] Priyanka: He wants to make Velliachan understand
[1/5/21, 1:57:14 AM] Priyanka: I said I want to cut contact
[1/5/21, 1:57:19 AM] Priyanka: He is broken
[1/5/21, 1:57:35 AM] Priyanka: Will you talk to him once
[1/5/21, 1:57:56 AM] Meghana: But velliachan and everyone will not agree this time Chinchu ...it looks like they have taken a very strong stand
[1/5/21, 1:58:06 AM] Priyanka: Ya I know
[1/5/21, 1:58:25 AM] Meghana: Yeah, this I can, but what can I tell him? 
Should Chinnu and I meet him?
[1/5/21, 1:58:25 AM] Priyanka: Only thing he said was migrate to us and we will see
[1/5/21, 1:58:34 AM] Priyanka: Not by doing masters but
[1/5/21, 1:59:10 AM] Priyanka: I'll ask chinnu. She never had a soft corner for him. But I'll ask
[1/5/21, 1:59:22 AM] Priyanka: I hope he is ok
[1/5/21, 1:59:51 AM] Meghana: No no, this time she has I think...everyone is feeling bad for him. He must also be in a very bad state
[1/5/21, 2:00:01 AM] Priyanka: Hmm
[1/5/21, 2:01:31 AM] Meghana: But this time everyone wants you to make a choice Chinchu, we have to make him understand and ensure he is doing fine tol
[1/5/21, 2:01:34 AM] Meghana: *too
[1/5/21, 2:01:59 AM] Meghana: It will take a lot of time, it will be hard. But you both are smart and bold
[1/5/21, 2:04:36 AM] Meghana: You spoke to him?
[1/5/21, 2:05:52 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[1/5/21, 2:06:42 AM] Meghana: Are velliamma and velliachan at home?
[1/5/21, 2:06:48 AM] Priyanka: No
[1/5/21, 2:07:13 AM] Meghana: Office?
[1/5/21, 2:07:23 AM] Priyanka: Dispensary
[1/5/21, 2:07:48 AM] Meghana: Where is he now?
[1/5/21, 2:08:02 AM] Priyanka: Same place he stayed last time
[1/5/21, 2:11:32 AM] Meghana: Or he can meet velliachan once 🤔
[1/5/21, 2:12:18 AM] Meghana: Or ask him to call velliachan and tell he’s in Mysore. Veliachan only might ask him to meet
[1/5/21, 2:15:59 AM] Priyanka: I am not sure if he told that to Velliachan
[1/5/21, 2:16:22 AM] Meghana: When did they speak?
[1/5/21, 2:17:17 AM] Meghana: Today morning?
[1/5/21, 2:17:21 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[1/5/21, 2:18:40 AM] Meghana: I think he should only call and tell.Because if they get to know later they will be angry again no🤔
[1/5/21, 2:18:59 AM] Meghana: So you ask him to speak to velliachan only once
[1/5/21, 2:34:46 AM] Meghana: What’s he planning to do?
[1/5/21, 4:04:38 AM] Priyanka: I don't know
[1/5/21, 4:04:42 AM] Priyanka: Honestly
[1/5/21, 4:04:47 AM] Priyanka: I asked him to go back
[1/5/21, 4:12:52 AM] Meghana: Hmmm, how’s he doing?
[1/5/21, 4:13:23 AM] Meghana: This must have been hard, but you’re being bold❤️
[1/5/21, 4:15:10 AM] Priyanka: I don't think he is even eating
[1/5/21, 4:15:23 AM] Priyanka: Breaks my heart di
[1/5/21, 4:28:19 AM] Meghana: 🥺 are his parents there for him?
[1/5/21, 4:30:01 AM] Meghana: He will understand Chinchu. He also probably won’t want you to leave your family for him. It will be a hard few of months. But you guys will get through. How are his friends? Has he told them ?
[1/5/21, 4:33:10 AM] Priyanka: Don't know
[1/5/21, 6:39:00 AM] Meghana: How are you holding up?
[1/5/21, 7:45:21 AM] Priyanka: Don't know
[1/5/21, 11:49:53 AM] Priyanka: What was the discussion today?
[1/5/21, 11:50:01 AM] Priyanka: I was stuck with work
[1/5/21, 11:50:10 AM] Priyanka: But figured it's about me
[1/5/21, 12:28:14 PM] Meghana: Yeah, the greater part😬
[1/5/21, 12:29:45 PM] Meghana: Discussion was the same only...velliamma is still very upset. They want you both to at least try cutting contact. For a few months at least.
[1/6/21, 2:18:02 AM] Meghana: You spoke to him Chinchu?
[1/6/21, 2:24:29 AM] Priyanka: Ya
[1/6/21, 2:25:49 AM] Meghana: He is in Mysore or did he go back?
[1/6/21, 2:27:57 AM] Meghana: Chinchu, we had supported you all this while, but after you saw how everyone cried and pleaded to at least try, I think you should put some effort at least. For a while, to see if you guys can go a few weeks without talking.
[1/6/21, 2:29:34 AM] Priyanka: I know, I could have hid the fact that he was in Mysore
[1/6/21, 2:29:39 AM] Priyanka: From you guys
[1/6/21, 2:30:15 AM] Priyanka: But I told you, so that you could go check on him. You people said you will help him rt
[1/6/21, 2:30:28 AM] Priyanka: Chinnu Chechi didn't even reply to his text
[1/6/21, 2:30:31 AM] Priyanka: Anyways
[1/6/21, 2:30:38 AM] Priyanka: I asked him to go back
[1/6/21, 2:31:01 AM] Priyanka: Wanted to meet him once and tell that I will not be in touch with him now on
[1/6/21, 2:31:10 AM] Priyanka: Told that to him on phone itself
[1/6/21, 2:32:52 AM] Meghana: I swear I can do this, I will talk to him if you want to and I won’t tell anyone. But that is only if you guys are willing to put some effort to not talk to each other for at least a few weeks.
[1/6/21, 2:33:55 AM] Priyanka: No da, leave it
[1/6/21, 2:34:26 AM] Priyanka: I'm not angry with you
[1/6/21, 2:34:34 AM] Priyanka: Just frustrated at this whole mess
[1/6/21, 2:34:50 AM] Meghana: But will you try putting the effort?
Meanwhile he can try to get to the US somehow
[1/6/21, 2:34:59 AM] Meghana: I get it
[1/6/21, 2:35:56 AM] Meghana: Chinchu, everyone just wants to know that you pay some respect to what they feel. Velliachan has budged already too. He will agree to it if he comes to the US
[1/6/21, 2:36:13 AM] Meghana: They will budge, but you have to meet us midway too
[1/6/21, 2:36:44 AM] Meghana: We will talk to him, I just don’t know how he will feel about someone younger than him talking to him, which is why I hadn’t
[1/6/21, 2:40:41 AM] Priyanka: It's ok Meghu

[7/11/21, 9:16:39 AM] Meghana: This was a couple of days back when I was here
[7/11/21, 12:13:22 PM] Priyanka: ‎Missed video call
[7/11/21, 12:13:34 PM] Priyanka: Trying to call you
[7/11/21, 12:16:57 PM] Priyanka: I'll call you right back.
[7/11/21, 12:17:07 PM] Meghana: Done done
[7/11/21, 12:23:35 PM] Priyanka: I was going to ask, how long for it to heal?
[7/11/21, 12:23:40 PM] Meghana: So th whole region hurts.
But I had a pain killer just now
[7/11/21, 12:23:43 PM] Meghana: Oh angane
[7/11/21, 12:23:48 PM] Meghana: It will take around 10 days
[7/11/21, 12:23:48 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[7/11/21, 12:23:58 PM] Priyanka: Oh.. liquid diet?
[7/11/21, 12:24:03 PM] Meghana: Since it’s in the oral cavity it will take some time
[7/11/21, 12:24:11 PM] Meghana: Liquid or soft foods
[7/11/21, 12:24:15 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[7/11/21, 12:24:20 PM] Meghana: Doctor said 2 weeks
[7/11/21, 12:24:27 PM] Meghana: But I’m hoping I’ll be fine by 10
[7/11/21, 12:24:30 PM] Priyanka: There are no side effects of removing that organ?
[7/11/21, 12:24:39 PM] Priyanka: Are you on leave?
[7/11/21, 12:24:56 PM] Meghana: No no, it’s usually only helpful for kids. As adults we don’t really need them
[7/11/21, 12:25:03 PM] Meghana: Yeah, sick leave for a few days
[7/11/21, 12:25:03 PM] Priyanka: Ohh
[7/11/21, 12:25:10 PM] Priyanka: Good
[7/11/21, 12:25:39 PM] Meghana: I ask doctor if there will be any side effects. At 23 n all our body only has that kind of resistance. Tonsils are not really required
[7/11/21, 12:25:48 PM] Meghana: Because can’t talk also.
[7/11/21, 12:25:59 PM] Meghana: But might have to start working slowly from Thursday
[7/11/21, 12:26:06 PM] Priyanka: What did you decide about gre?
[7/11/21, 12:26:10 PM] Priyanka: Hmm
[7/11/21, 12:26:49 PM] Meghana: Postponed to 3 weeks from now.
So I asked my PM about this, when I could take leave for the surgery because there is a lot of stuff going on at office
[7/11/21, 12:27:19 PM] Meghana: And he suggested to get it done and be fine by the time our REdHat engagements resume. They resume on 21st of this month
[7/11/21, 12:27:24 PM] Meghana: And will go on for a while
[7/11/21, 12:27:43 PM] Meghana: I was scared third wave would begin by then and that I wouldn’t be able to get this done
[7/11/21, 12:27:54 PM] Meghana: So I’ll take GRE on 6th
[7/11/21, 12:28:13 PM] Priyanka: Aug?
[7/11/21, 12:28:28 PM] Meghana: Yeah
[7/11/21, 12:28:32 PM] Priyanka: Cool
[7/11/21, 12:28:37 PM] Meghana: 3 weeks from now
[7/11/21, 12:28:44 PM] Meghana: I might need 2 weeks for recovery
[7/11/21, 12:28:51 PM] Meghana: And a week from then I’ll just go take it
[7/11/21, 12:29:02 PM] Priyanka: Ok.. take proper care
[7/11/21, 12:29:20 PM] Meghana: Yeah, it is frustrating to not be able to talk😭
[7/11/21, 12:29:33 PM] Priyanka: I never knew removing your tonsils was an option until now 😂
[7/11/21, 12:29:54 PM] Priyanka: There will be some peace and quiet at varnam for a few days
[7/11/21, 12:30:15 PM] Meghana: 😂😂

[3/31/22, 3:13:49 AM] Priyanka: Right
[4/4/22, 12:53:42 PM] Meghana: Chinchu, I understand I haven’t given you a treat, I should have given you one long ago. Let’s go out for dinner day after tomorrow.
But it really hurts when Chinnu keeps saying that I don’t treat. I have treated and gifted everyone except Rahul Ettan and you when I got into Cisco. And I did not skimp on any of those, I gave everyone good treats, my parents, Abhi, velliachans, velliammas, Abhi and Swati. For Arjun’s, yes, I haven’t given a formal treat. But he had treated everyone at Bangalore on our way to Pondi, I thought that would suffice. There also you were not there. I really want to give you a treat. So let’s do that. But tbh, I don’t like how Chinnu keeps saying I haven’t treated at all. And each time she says it, she does it with too much vigour. It really hurts.
[4/4/22, 12:58:45 PM] Meghana: Also, for Arjun’s, there is an engagement function. But that also you’ll miss🙈 So for all of that let’s go out.
[4/4/22, 1:35:53 PM] Priyanka: Hey Meghu, chill. Unfortunately Chinnu chechi saw the long message as I was going to text the event planner and asked me what it was and since I didn’t know the content, we read it together. 
She was upset and vent out to me that it’s not that she wants a treat badly or anything, but CMU is a big big happy thing that happened in your life right. Every happy moment in our lives were celebrated with you guys. Anyways, don’t think a lot about it. Chuck it if you are running low on funds. It is usual for us sisters to keep nagging on each other.
[4/4/22, 1:37:58 PM] Meghana: It’s okay that she saw. Not a problem. Yes, nagging is chill, I like that. And I never felt anything when you asked. But every time this topic has come up(even in the past) she was a little aggressive and that really hurts. It’s like I haven’t treated at all.
