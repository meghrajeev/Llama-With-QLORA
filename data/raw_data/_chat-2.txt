[7/3/21, 4:55:04 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But you get the point
[7/3/21, 4:55:07 PM] Meghana: Aah yes, this I remember
[7/3/21, 4:55:16 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Overlap 😂
[7/3/21, 4:55:44 PM] Meghana: 😂😂
[7/3/21, 4:55:47 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Only of education years not girls
[7/3/21, 4:55:53 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Incase you were confused
[7/3/21, 4:56:05 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Can't date 2 people and all at the same time.. too much stress
[7/3/21, 4:56:21 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂oh God, that was funny
[7/3/21, 4:56:32 PM] Meghana: I did not think this😂😂
[7/3/21, 4:56:43 PM] Meghana: But wait, now I’m wondering why I did not think of it that way
[7/3/21, 4:56:52 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I was just being clear
[7/3/21, 4:57:04 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😵to remember all the lies itself seems like one big job
[7/3/21, 4:57:23 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Since you haven't met me, you might think I can date 2 people and all 🙈
[7/3/21, 4:57:40 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: My digital impression is all I've got rn🙈
[7/3/21, 4:57:54 PM] Meghana: 😂😂 good you cleared this then
[7/3/21, 4:58:03 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂so far so good but

[7/3/21, 4:58:36 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Validation++
[7/3/21, 5:00:09 PM] Meghana: 😂😂you seem like a really nice person. I don’t think I’d have thought you’d date two people at once😂
[7/3/21, 5:00:18 PM] Meghana: Unless it was an open relationship n all
[7/3/21, 5:00:33 PM] Meghana: Then I don’t know, because I’ve never really understood how those work😵
[7/3/21, 5:01:37 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Usually I'm very confident in things I do.. cause I know and understand them. When it comes to girls and relationships I am generally a bit shy idk why.. it's always hard to place and understand some emotions 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:02:46 PM] Meghana: I figured this🙈
Is it like the idea of a relationship that you shy away from?
[7/3/21, 5:03:34 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: No no
[7/3/21, 5:03:43 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Just inexperience I guess
[7/3/21, 5:03:50 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's a bit of an unknown no
[7/3/21, 5:04:37 PM] Meghana: Aye, you’ve had two long enough relationships no😮
[7/3/21, 5:04:42 PM] Meghana: That’s there🤔
[7/3/21, 5:04:45 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: See you take something like sports , I can practice every day play more and more game.. how to do that in a relationship 🙈 daily New relationship is a little hard no
[7/3/21, 5:04:58 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Every person is unique no
[7/3/21, 5:05:35 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: If I make a mistake today I'll fix and come back tomorrow. In a relationship that may not happen.. might not be a tomorrow to come back to no
[7/3/21, 5:05:45 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ooof.. too deep too deep
[7/3/21, 5:05:58 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂daily new relationship it seems.
I don’t know who does this😂 why not work on the same one instead da?😂
[7/3/21, 5:05:58 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Let's move on to lighter topics 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:06:16 PM] Meghana: Yes😮😮 shit, that was deep
[7/3/21, 5:06:25 PM] Meghana: But there could be a tomorrow
[7/3/21, 5:06:30 PM] Meghana: Just with a different person
[7/3/21, 5:06:33 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I do , I mean I will.
[7/3/21, 5:06:37 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Always 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:06:38 PM] Meghana: So there is room for correction for sure
[7/3/21, 5:07:15 PM] Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂but we only tangentially touched this
[7/3/21, 5:07:42 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Tangent to full blown perpendicular doesn't take time 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:07:59 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But if you want to continue to talk about this , I don't mind 😌
[7/3/21, 5:10:11 PM] Meghana: Ahha, I’m  trying to understand the metaphor here
[7/3/21, 5:10:33 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Too geometric no 😂
[7/3/21, 5:10:50 PM] Meghana: 😂😂the geometry I understood, but that was about it
[7/3/21, 5:10:52 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: So if you drop a perpendicular to a tangent it passes through the center of the circle
[7/3/21, 5:11:38 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Tangentially touching to perpendicular ie just scratching to going right into the middle of the circle
[7/3/21, 5:11:45 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's what I was going for 🙈
[7/3/21, 5:13:37 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Leave it
[7/3/21, 5:13:45 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It was a little lame only 😂😂
[7/3/21, 5:13:55 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Too nerdy
[7/3/21, 5:14:22 PM] Meghana: It was going above my head da😂
I tried re reading n all. But the time is not right. I’ll read this again in the morning. 
The math I understood though😂
[7/3/21, 5:14:48 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's ok. 😂😂

[7/3/21, 5:15:43 PM] Meghana: Yes, I think I’ll be awake. No sleep since the past two days😭
[7/3/21, 5:15:47 PM] Meghana: Why?😮

[7/3/21, 5:16:00 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I've to go help them out
[7/3/21, 5:16:45 PM] Meghana: Oh😮shit, 9 sounds too early. Especially because it’s almost 3 and you are still awake😮
[7/3/21, 5:17:31 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Yaa
[7/3/21, 5:17:37 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I shall try to quick nap

[7/9/21, 8:18:08 PM] Meghana: The nurse just came and told
[7/9/21, 8:18:19 PM] Meghana: Don’t know when I’ll be able to meet the surgeon
[7/9/21, 8:18:27 PM] Meghana: I actually had first met a doctor at Bangalore
[7/9/21, 8:18:30 PM] Meghana: Some time ago
[7/9/21, 8:18:35 PM] Meghana: I wanted to get it done by her
[7/9/21, 8:18:49 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh

[7/9/21, 8:20:39 PM] Meghana: That I’m very bold n all😂
And I usually smile a lot, so they know I’m okay
[7/9/21, 8:20:50 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I don't think we'll ever understand unless we are in their place
[7/9/21, 8:21:19 PM] Meghana: True, this I also thought . But this is a lot of worrying no😵
But I guess this sort of naturally comes
[7/9/21, 8:21:37 PM] Meghana: No matter how much we say we won’t be like them
[7/9/21, 8:21:49 PM] Meghana: I keep asking parents to be very selfish and think more about themselves
[7/9/21, 8:21:58 PM] Meghana: But they don’t 😑
[7/9/21, 8:22:10 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Generation gap 😂
[7/9/21, 8:22:16 PM] Meghana: I tell them also that they don’t have to feel guilty about this because I’m going to do this to my kids😂
[7/9/21, 8:22:38 PM] Meghana: Big one😂😂
But I’m sure we will all be like this eventually
[7/9/21, 8:22:46 PM] Meghana: When the time comes
[7/9/21, 8:23:00 PM] Meghana: But you know what I won’t like
[7/9/21, 8:23:14 PM] Meghana: My kids dating, I think I’ll get annoyed and possessive 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:23:19 PM] Meghana: Especially if it’s a son
[7/9/21, 8:23:22 PM] Meghana: 😪😪😪😭😭
[7/9/21, 8:23:43 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I mean I will be a different parent to my child for sure. But that's not cause what my mom and dad is was wrong of anything.. just a different approach
[7/9/21, 8:24:00 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:24:33 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: This is going to be fun to watch 😂
[7/9/21, 8:24:36 PM] Meghana: Yeah, that yes, I keep telling parents also this all the time. But the worrying will always be there I guess
[7/9/21, 8:24:45 PM] Meghana: 😭😭it’s going to be very hurtful
[7/9/21, 8:25:01 PM] Meghana: I’m sure they’ll come home one day saying they’ve found one bitch😪
[7/9/21, 8:25:20 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Already soo judgemental 😂
[7/9/21, 8:25:30 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Give the girl a chance no 🙈

[7/9/21, 8:26:01 PM] Meghana: She has to be really good😪😪
I’ll think about this. But I just hope they don’t find anyone too soon
[7/9/21, 8:26:05 PM] Meghana: I feel really evil😂
[7/9/21, 8:26:10 PM] Meghana: But it’s okay🤭
[7/9/21, 8:26:25 PM] Meghana: I think if it’s a daughter she can date🤔
[7/9/21, 8:26:55 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Think about it like you are the girl and your boyfriend's mother doesn't give you a chance 😂
[7/9/21, 8:27:00 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Then you'll understand
[7/9/21, 8:27:10 PM] Meghana: 😮😮😮😮😮
[7/9/21, 8:27:16 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Why this gender bias
[7/9/21, 8:28:12 PM] Meghana: Oh damn, no no no no😮😮 that will be horrible . Shit.
But yes, I think I’ll also eventually come around, but it will be hard to accept initially 😪😪😪or maybe I’ll just gel with her really well
[7/9/21, 8:28:19 PM] Meghana: I don’t understand either😂😂😂
[7/9/21, 8:29:02 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: In sure you'll eventually come around. It's just the initial emotion 😂
[7/9/21, 8:29:05 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Im *
[7/9/21, 8:29:45 PM] Meghana: Yes, I think after some time I’ll just get used to the fact. Until then I’ll just eat up my sorrow😪
[7/9/21, 8:30:25 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Eat up my sorrow itseems 🙈
[7/9/21, 8:30:34 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Go rant to your husband

[7/9/21, 8:30:57 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I guess by that point he'll be good at it
[7/9/21, 8:30:59 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂
[7/9/21, 8:31:19 PM] Meghana: Yes yes, he’ll be used to it by then😂 but I won’t do that annoying rant I think

But to keep 0 expectations and give that much is hard right? 
As in, if that isn’t reciprocated even a little bit it’s hard right?
[7/27/21, 6:13:09 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hmm.. I expect a lot of myself
[7/27/21, 6:13:18 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I make sure others don't expect too much

[7/27/21, 6:39:04 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I make sure others don't expect much of me so whatever I do they aren't disappointed.
But I expect a lot out of myself so I'm almost always disappointed (not good , but sometimes motivating)
[7/27/21, 6:55:58 AM] Meghana: Oh yeah, I actually can totally relate to the second part.

[8/19/21, 10:36:00 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: And then stopped for some reason 🙈
[8/19/21, 10:36:19 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: (which I still don't know/understand)
[8/19/21, 2:51:00 PM] Meghana: We vibed really really well. Had mentioned to Manasa also about you. Even the call with you was extremely easy. Everything was great. Had deleted Hinge and everything.
But I didn’t know what our equation was. You did mention you were shy when it came to girls.
But meanwhile something happened. So remember I told you about the guy who almost dated my cousin. The guy and I got quite close after that. And I didn’t know what was happening between us(you and I) and I didn’t want to lead on because the other guy and I started getting close. 
But I still keep telling Manasa how well we had connected
[8/19/21, 2:51:15 PM] Meghana: 😢😢
[8/19/21, 3:06:43 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's fine. I mean we don't control what happens to us and when. 
You could have just told me, or asked me and I'd have told you where we stand. 
But it's cool, you let me know where you are right now and what you want to do. If you'd rather us not talk, that's also fine (will be a bit sad) but I respect that.
[8/19/21, 3:17:52 PM] Meghana: I wanted to ask you, but somehow the conversation never came up. So then I wondered what the equation was. 
No no, I’d love for us to talk. We connected very well. Communication gap came in the way.
But the other guy and I are very close. We are planning on dating and seeing how it goes.
[8/19/21, 4:09:51 PM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Understandable. I was just taking my time, given that you are back in Mysore and I'm here. But I'm glad you told me. ✌️
[8/19/21, 11:19:55 PM] Meghana: Yes, that I understand now. Shit. But since nothing on those lines came up in our conversations (my bad too, I should have brought it up) I thought it wasn’t happening.
So we won’t talk at all?
[8/20/21, 1:38:24 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's alright.
[8/20/21, 1:38:41 AM] ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ayy no, I'd really like to still talk to you, if you are ok with it ofc
[8/20/21, 3:00:38 PM] Meghana: Yes yes, I’d love it too🤩
I’d really love for us to still talk
