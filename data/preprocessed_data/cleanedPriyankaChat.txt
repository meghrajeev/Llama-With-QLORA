 Priyanka: Send
 Priyanka: Which algorithm are you using?
 Priyanka: Today I might be a bit held up
 Priyanka: By when do you want it
 Meghana: Mobile net,exception model
 Meghana: No problem,whenever you are free

 Meghana: I referred to other projects obviously 🤭
‎ Meghana: ‎image omitted
 Meghana: Is the code working fine?
 Meghana: Can you screenshot the outputs also once it’s done?
‎ Priyanka: ‎image omitted
 Priyanka: Ya

 Meghana: If your laptop tends to go to the sleep mode when you don’t use it,the algorithm will stop
 Meghana: Happened to me last night😭
 Meghana: So you might have to go to the control panel and make that never
 Priyanka: Did that before only
 Priyanka: Goodnight 😘
 Meghana: Good day😘😘love you❤️
 Priyanka: I've been running the code since morning 😅
 Priyanka: 2 epochs done
 Meghana: How many done now?
 Priyanka: Running since two days

 Priyanka: So it stopped
 Priyanka: There is no resume also
 Priyanka: How many epochs are done in yours?
 Meghana: Yeah
 Meghana: But I think there is an option to change that
 Priyanka: .
 Meghana: Closing the lid
 Priyanka: Ohh
 Meghana: 29 I think
 Priyanka: You need 25 rt!
 Meghana: In the code that I sent you it’s 25... in the code that I’m running on my system I’ve kept it to 40
 Priyanka: 🙏🏼
 Priyanka: All the best
 Priyanka: You will overfit the data 😂
 Meghana: But I’ve given early stopping 🤔
 Meghana: Can’t even check with different epochs 😓
 Priyanka: How do you decide on the number?
 Meghana: I don’t know for sure how many epochs I need to run
 Meghana: Had seen a couple of notebooks where people ran around 30 n all
 Priyanka: You should have tried 25
 Priyanka: What's the accuracy for 29th
 Meghana: True 🤔
 Meghana: Wait,will check once
 Priyanka: Tell me tomorrow, go to sleep
 Meghana: 82%
 Priyanka: Wow.. good enough
 Priyanka: Don't overfit *
 Meghana: Loss is 0.5, it was 2.8 after the first epoch
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Won’t know until this is done😓
 Priyanka: When is the submission? 😂
 Meghana: Oh wait
 Meghana: Actually,there isn’t any overfitting
‎ Meghana: ‎image omitted
 Priyanka: You will know only when you use test data rt
 Meghana: I’ve already created a validation set to check that
 Priyanka: Cool
 Priyanka: Then ok
 Meghana: But want the loss to decrease further
 Priyanka: Wait for a couple of days 👍🏼
 Meghana: Don’t think it will decrease much further than this

 Meghana: In the toilet🤭
 Priyanka: Chinnu chechi told me that Velliachan told your parents
 Meghana: Yes
 Priyanka: What did your dad say
 Meghana: They still seem to be in a shock...but they’ll come around
 Meghana: They are just worried about the communication n all
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: There was this huge discussion yesterday after they were told
 Meghana: Velliachan and velliamma were here till almost 11:30
 Priyanka: You guys don't have to defend me in front of them .. don't want to put you guys in bad light
 Priyanka: What exactly did cochachan say
 Meghana: What are you saying 🤦🏾‍♀️
It’s okay,no problem🤦🏾‍♀️
What we have to do now is get everyone to be happy about it no..
 Meghana: For a long time he was shocked
 Meghana: Now he’s mainly just worried about how his family is n all
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: And also I was telling no,that they have something against Telegites for some reason
 Meghana: But they seem to be okay with that now
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Priyanka: I know this is not going to be easy
 Priyanka: I have to be ready for it
 Meghana: In the end they’ll agree
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: But when you come back you might have to be prepared for some drama
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: Or maybe by then they might just accept it and be okay with it
 Priyanka: Hmm.. I feel Velliachan understands me
 Priyanka: And he has got velliama to understand
 Meghana: But they are really upset..until yesterday actually I hadn’t realised ..velliamma teared up..velliachan also was telling that he is very disturbed...they were telling that they are only trying to be okay with it because they don’t have another choice...
Like they are really upset..
But this was expected no...when they meet him their opinion will change..he is a really nice guy
 Meghana: They’ll also understand that and actually come to terms with it,like for real
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: This lockdown 🤦🏾‍♀️
Else Veliachan could have met him
 Priyanka: Ya
 Priyanka: He is ready to talk to Velliachan
 Priyanka: I asked him to wait
 Meghana: Maybe a couple of months more🤔
But he should speak to velliachan..
Velliachan was saying that he won’t make the first move and wants him to talk to him first
 Priyanka: Hmm.. I know
 Meghana: After the lockdown ends,they should probably meet once
 Meghana: You look really pretty in your dp🤔I clicked no?🤭
 Priyanka: Ya 😛
 Priyanka: Where is the dance!!??

 Meghana: How are things in the US now?
 Priyanka: Dropped a bomb on all my plans

 Priyanka: Hopefully
 Priyanka: Retail and other related companies are a total mess now
 Priyanka: Like travel industries too
 Priyanka: So there are only one four jobs that used to be
 Meghana: Oh😑 data analytics department is quite a thing in companies like these
 Priyanka: I know.. there is still scope, but only after everything gets back to normal.. now most are on hiring freeze.. and I don't have that much time

For how long can companies go on like this after all
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Priyanka: Let's hope for the best
 Meghana: Yes.. hope everything goes well
 Meghana: Don’t worry, you will get a job
 Meghana: A good job
 Priyanka: 😘

 Meghana: I fell asleep after work
 Meghana: Then I forgot😵
 Meghana: Pakka
 Meghana: Tomorrow
 Meghana: 💯
 Priyanka: 😅 podi
 Priyanka: Yesterday I ran out of charge
 Priyanka: During the call
 Meghana: Just woke up😵😵
 Meghana: Yeah,I thought so too
 Meghana: Did you and Chinnu talk after that?
 Priyanka: Nope
 Meghana: Thing is, we were just trying to put across what is happening here..but it came out very rudely🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
 Meghana: Sorry Chinchu
 Priyanka: It's ok
 Priyanka: It's not that I don't feel badly about it
 Priyanka: And it's not that I don't feel guilt
 Priyanka: You didn't say anything 😅
 Priyanka: I'll sort it with chinnu
 Meghana: Yeah, we know that you are feeling really bad too..
 Meghana: But it’s okay..athonnum paranjittu ippo karyam illa
 Priyanka: Did cochachan say anything after that?
 Meghana: After that he didn’t say anything..day before yesterday when velliachan and Chinnu came home they were talking about it , but I was upstairs..so don’t know what he said
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: He is also asking the same thing actually...Veliachanum velliammayum ithrem paranjittu why isn’t she leaving it
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: He is actually still hopeful it will end
 Priyanka: And Vani Aunty?
 Meghana: But Veliachan has showed him his picture the other day and he was like “Ahha, nalla Payyan aanallo”
 Priyanka: He is da.. I hope they see how much he cares for me.. our families are very different .. agreed.. but I'm sure I will work that out
 Meghana: Amma on the day she got to know she was saying it will be hard for you to adjust and things like that...she still says them..but now she is more like if she thinks he is a good guy,she might be right..we can’t force her into something she doesn’t want no,ennokke
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: You know how dad can act when he is upset no,that’s all this is...once it sinks in he will be fine
 Meghana: The day he went to office after he got to know he came back and was all like “enikkinnu officeil ithu thanne aayirunnu chintha”
 Priyanka: Hmm.. can't bear to think about losing their affection for me
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: They will get over it ...they haven’t lost their affection towards you n all ...dad was saying “She won’t have a problem ,even if she can’t get along with his family...we are all there for her no,and he is there”
 Meghana: It will just take some time to digest the fact
 Priyanka: 🙈 that's enough for me to feel better
 Priyanka: Thanks Meghu
 Meghana: Once velliachan and velliamma speak to him and they get to know that he is a nice guy and when they tell that to parents they will be on board with the whole idea”
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: 🧐thanks it seems
 Meghana: What’s the time there🤔
 Priyanka: I've been really down since two days
 Priyanka: I feel a weird sense of peace
 Priyanka: 2
 Meghana: I also thought you might be down
 Meghana: That day also you weren’t saying anything no
 Meghana: 😵😵😵😵
 Priyanka: Hmm.. I don't have the right to say anything
 Priyanka: I know I have hurt people
 Meghana: They are hurt only because they don’t want to see you struggle .... finally your happiness is their happiness...
After the wedding when they see you happy they will forget all this
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: The only thing that worries them is whether you can adjust to all of it..
 Priyanka: Hmm.. I am also not a hundred percent sure if I can adjust.. but I know I will try my best
 Meghana: It will be very difficult
 Priyanka: That too.. is a matter of time
 Meghana: Yes, maybe after a couple of years everything will fall into the grove
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: If only they were settled somewhere here only,like in Mysore and Bangalore 😭
 Priyanka: 😅 thank God I didn't fall for a north Indian.. what would you say then
 Meghana: 😂😂😂
 Meghana: But we all know Hindi no🤔
 Priyanka: Hmm... I'll learn some telgu and teach you guys the essential
 Priyanka: 😅
 Meghana: Velliachan has already started😂
 Priyanka: Ohh
 Priyanka: 😅
 Meghana: He randomly says some Telugu words these days it seems😂
 Priyanka: I have the best family I could ever ask for

 Priyanka: Is this for BE?
 Priyanka: ‎Missed voice call
 Priyanka: ‎Missed voice call
 Priyanka: I'll call you right back.
 Meghana: Wokay
 Priyanka: There?
‎ Priyanka: ‎video omitted
 Meghana: 😍😍😍😍
 Meghana: Also,you have become damn thin
 Priyanka: Patni 😅
 Meghana: Patni🤔? Whose?🤔
 Priyanka: Pattini.. hunger in malayalam
 Meghana: Oh😂😂😂angane
 Meghana: Nallatha😂😂in a way😂
 Priyanka: 😂
 Priyanka: Do something impromptu
 Priyanka: Like this
 Meghana: What’s happening 🤦🏾‍♀️
 Priyanka: What did she tell you
 Meghana: I know she was kind of rude when she said all that and should have considered that you were alone...
 Meghana: But why are you both fighting like this🤦🏾‍♀️
You guys need to sit and talk
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: I understand he was angry , but she was just putting across what was happening at home
 Meghana: Both you and Chinnu are equally frustrated
 Meghana: That’s why
 Priyanka: Ya.. chinnu chechi sent me a recording of what velliama.. I cried badly.. who else do I share the pain with?
 Priyanka: I never put her in bad light. He thought why can't she understand I'm alone here.  He sent the message without me knowing. I then made him understand that she gets to hear what mom and dad talk everyday
 Priyanka: *velliama said
 Priyanka: Did she tell you anything more
 Priyanka: These two have low tempers
 Priyanka: I'm not frustrated. Just sad.
 Meghana: Yes, I understand that..obviously you need to talk about what you feel to someone..it’s totally understandable that you spoke to him about it...
But everything that she is saying, aarayalum paranju pokunna karyangal aanu... 
And yes, knowing what exactly is happening here is not any easier for you either... but someone has got to tell you what exactly is happening here as well right... and you have always known that all this would happen.. it hasn’t come as a shock... 
crying about it won’t solve it... you will have to hear a lot more when you come back too... but vishamichu irunnu happiness okke kalayunnathil what’s the point
 Meghana: She was crying
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: You have to try and be bold unless you have plans to let him go... and that won’t happen, so the only option here is to be bold
 Priyanka: Ya
 Priyanka: I am torn between two thoughts
 Priyanka: Never wanted to hurt my parents
 Meghana: Giving up on people is not easy
 Meghana: Now it’s too late anyway.. but to be totally honest,you could have put some effort before itself 🤔
 Meghana: That’s how the system works 😭 it’s not your fault..
 Priyanka: I didn't want to give him up then, not now
 Priyanka: I wanted everyone to accept him and be happy. But that's a dream
 Priyanka: I have to face it. I'm ok with that. Crying is a way of coping
 Priyanka: I'll try being bolder
 Priyanka: I'm not blaming chinnu chechi of anything. I totally get her
 Meghana: That’s where priorities come into picture Chinchu...
That’s why they are also sad... that you didn’t put any effort
But nobody can be blamed here... for how long can people tame their hearts
 Meghana: You should probably get used to it also😂
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Point is, just try and be bolder
 Priyanka: Ya
 Priyanka: I thought maybe distance from him will give me clarity. And it did. I'm sure about him.
I know families are very different. We will do our best to work all of it out.
 Meghana: She fights like crazy with everyone here when they scold you also... it works both ways
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Priyanka: I know
 Meghana: How’s the project thing going?
 Priyanka: Didn't do anything today. Let me get back to work
 Meghana: Yes,For now leave all this aside, don’t think about it
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: Things will hopefully get better
 Priyanka: You go to sleep
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Yes
 Meghana: And if you’re trying to look for a job, give that your all.. all this was expected, try not to be upset
 Priyanka: Doing that
 Meghana: Have a good day then, I’ll also go sleep
 Meghana: Buhbye
 Priyanka: Gn
 Priyanka: Call me once you wake up
 Meghana: Had a college presentation and sync up meeting at office..that’s why it got late
 Meghana: You slept?
 Priyanka: Ya
 Priyanka: You called me when I was in deep sleep. I did you a theri 😅
 Priyanka: Done?
 Priyanka: Call me
 Meghana: Now?
 Meghana: 10 min,will call

 Priyanka: Hey
 Meghana: Hey Chinchu
 Priyanka: How did Bangalore Velliachan know we both met Mahesh before I left to US?
 Meghana: I am also thinking the same thing...I have no clue how he got to know😢
 Priyanka: Swati knew
 Priyanka: Simply dragged you also in
 Meghana: Did they overhear any conversation?
 Priyanka: No I think
 Meghana: I was telling no, mother got doubt that day
 Priyanka: I didn't stay there before leaving for US
 Priyanka: No Velliachan new specifically
 Priyanka: Leave it now
 Meghana: Dad was also asking yesterday
 Priyanka: Mom scolded me for hiding everything in the beginning
 Meghana: But you told them in September itself right?
 Meghana: Like a month after you left
 Priyanka: Ya, but not that I was seeing him when I was at sap
 Meghana: Tell them that nothing was sure then, he came to see off, that’s all...things started later
 Meghana: Stand by what you said yesterday only
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: That he just came, that’s all
 Priyanka: Said I was sure about him after going to US
 Meghana: Yeah, tell that until then you would talk, that’s all
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Nothing was happening
 Meghana: How are you feeling today?
 Priyanka: I don't know Meghu how to get through this
 Priyanka: Mostly worried for him
 Priyanka: He is in Mysore
 Priyanka: I didn't go to meet
 Priyanka: He wanted to come home and talk to Velliachan
 Meghana: Oh shit, is he coming home? He can come home and talk then no?
 Priyanka: Velliachan said whatever he wanted on phone only
 Meghana: Oh😮
 Meghana: Maybe they can talk in person and velliachan can make him understand
 Meghana: ?
 Meghana: How’s he holding up?
 Priyanka: He wants to make Velliachan understand
 Priyanka: I said I want to cut contact
 Priyanka: He is broken
 Priyanka: Will you talk to him once
 Meghana: But velliachan and everyone will not agree this time Chinchu ...it looks like they have taken a very strong stand
 Priyanka: Ya I know
 Meghana: Yeah, this I can, but what can I tell him? 
Should Chinnu and I meet him?
 Priyanka: Only thing he said was migrate to us and we will see
 Priyanka: Not by doing masters but
 Priyanka: I'll ask chinnu. She never had a soft corner for him. But I'll ask
 Priyanka: I hope he is ok
 Meghana: No no, this time she has I think...everyone is feeling bad for him. He must also be in a very bad state
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: But this time everyone wants you to make a choice Chinchu, we have to make him understand and ensure he is doing fine tol
 Meghana: *too
 Meghana: It will take a lot of time, it will be hard. But you both are smart and bold
 Meghana: You spoke to him?
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: Are velliamma and velliachan at home?
 Priyanka: No
 Meghana: Office?
 Priyanka: Dispensary
 Meghana: Where is he now?
 Priyanka: Same place he stayed last time
 Meghana: Or he can meet velliachan once 🤔
 Meghana: Or ask him to call velliachan and tell he’s in Mysore. Veliachan only might ask him to meet
 Priyanka: I am not sure if he told that to Velliachan
 Meghana: When did they speak?
 Meghana: Today morning?
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: I think he should only call and tell.Because if they get to know later they will be angry again no🤔
 Meghana: So you ask him to speak to velliachan only once
 Meghana: What’s he planning to do?
 Priyanka: I don't know
 Priyanka: Honestly
 Priyanka: I asked him to go back
 Meghana: Hmmm, how’s he doing?
 Meghana: This must have been hard, but you’re being bold❤️
 Priyanka: I don't think he is even eating
 Priyanka: Breaks my heart di
 Meghana: 🥺 are his parents there for him?
 Meghana: He will understand Chinchu. He also probably won’t want you to leave your family for him. It will be a hard few of months. But you guys will get through. How are his friends? Has he told them ?
 Priyanka: Don't know
 Meghana: How are you holding up?
 Priyanka: Don't know
 Priyanka: What was the discussion today?
 Priyanka: I was stuck with work
 Priyanka: But figured it's about me
 Meghana: Yeah, the greater part😬
 Meghana: Discussion was the same only...velliamma is still very upset. They want you both to at least try cutting contact. For a few months at least.
 Meghana: You spoke to him Chinchu?
 Priyanka: Ya
 Meghana: He is in Mysore or did he go back?
 Meghana: Chinchu, we had supported you all this while, but after you saw how everyone cried and pleaded to at least try, I think you should put some effort at least. For a while, to see if you guys can go a few weeks without talking.
 Priyanka: I know, I could have hid the fact that he was in Mysore
 Priyanka: From you guys
 Priyanka: But I told you, so that you could go check on him. You people said you will help him rt
 Priyanka: Chinnu Chechi didn't even reply to his text
 Priyanka: Anyways
 Priyanka: I asked him to go back
 Priyanka: Wanted to meet him once and tell that I will not be in touch with him now on
 Priyanka: Told that to him on phone itself
 Meghana: I swear I can do this, I will talk to him if you want to and I won’t tell anyone. But that is only if you guys are willing to put some effort to not talk to each other for at least a few weeks.
 Priyanka: No da, leave it
 Priyanka: I'm not angry with you
 Priyanka: Just frustrated at this whole mess
 Meghana: But will you try putting the effort?
Meanwhile he can try to get to the US somehow
 Meghana: I get it
 Meghana: Chinchu, everyone just wants to know that you pay some respect to what they feel. Velliachan has budged already too. He will agree to it if he comes to the US
 Meghana: They will budge, but you have to meet us midway too
 Meghana: We will talk to him, I just don’t know how he will feel about someone younger than him talking to him, which is why I hadn’t
 Priyanka: It's ok Meghu
 Priyanka: Like I said I'm not angry at you people
 Priyanka: What doing
 Meghana: Nothing much here, just had breakfast
 Meghana: What’s up there? What are you guys up to?

 Priyanka: Call me on duo
 Meghana: Yeah, will do that. Let me see if I have the app
 Priyanka: Were you able to go to nikunj
 Meghana: Yes yes

 Priyanka: 👏
 Priyanka: What was her reaction
 Meghana: She was extremely surprised
 Meghana: She wasn’t understanding 😂😂
 Priyanka: Adipoli
 Meghana: Yeah😂
She is impressed 😂I think he’s safe
 Priyanka: Thanks he says
 Meghana: 🤭🙈
 Meghana: Welcome
 Priyanka: How you doing after the surgery
 Meghana: It hurts bad. But otherwise fine
 Meghana: The nausea is gone
 Priyanka: Good
 Priyanka: Take rest
 Meghana: Yes Chinchu🙈
‎ Meghana: ‎video omitted
‎ Meghana: ‎video omitted
 Priyanka: Is he looking for you??
 Meghana: No no, he wants to get onto the bed
 Meghana: This was a couple of days back when I was here
 Priyanka: ‎Missed video call
 Priyanka: Trying to call you
 Priyanka: I'll call you right back.
 Meghana: Done done
 Priyanka: I was going to ask, how long for it to heal?
 Meghana: So th whole region hurts.
But I had a pain killer just now
 Meghana: Oh angane
 Meghana: It will take around 10 days
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Priyanka: Oh.. liquid diet?
 Meghana: Since it’s in the oral cavity it will take some time
 Meghana: Liquid or soft foods
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Doctor said 2 weeks
 Meghana: But I’m hoping I’ll be fine by 10
 Priyanka: There are no side effects of removing that organ?
 Priyanka: Are you on leave?
 Meghana: No no, it’s usually only helpful for kids. As adults we don’t really need them
 Meghana: Yeah, sick leave for a few days
 Priyanka: Ohh
 Priyanka: Good
 Meghana: I ask doctor if there will be any side effects. At 23 n all our body only has that kind of resistance. Tonsils are not really required
 Meghana: Because can’t talk also.
 Meghana: But might have to start working slowly from Thursday
 Priyanka: What did you decide about gre?
 Priyanka: Hmm
 Meghana: Postponed to 3 weeks from now.
So I asked my PM about this, when I could take leave for the surgery because there is a lot of stuff going on at office
 Meghana: And he suggested to get it done and be fine by the time our REdHat engagements resume. They resume on 21st of this month
 Meghana: And will go on for a while
 Meghana: I was scared third wave would begin by then and that I wouldn’t be able to get this done
 Meghana: So I’ll take GRE on 6th
 Priyanka: Aug?
 Meghana: Yeah
 Priyanka: Cool
 Meghana: 3 weeks from now
 Meghana: I might need 2 weeks for recovery
 Meghana: And a week from then I’ll just go take it
 Priyanka: Ok.. take proper care
 Meghana: Yeah, it is frustrating to not be able to talk😭
 Priyanka: I never knew removing your tonsils was an option until now 😂
 Priyanka: There will be some peace and quiet at varnam for a few days
 Meghana: 😂😂
Surprisingly A lot of people get it done these days. In India it’s not so common yet, but in the US n all it’s fairly common
 Meghana: 😭😭😭
 Priyanka: Ok.. rest maadi
 Priyanka: Love to Olive ❤️
 Meghana: Aye❤️❤️❤️
 Priyanka: Send more videos
 Meghana: Yeah, I’ll send all the ones I have right now

 Priyanka: Color 👌🏻
 Meghana: Aah, then wokay
 Meghana: Getting blouse piece was hard but for this colour 😵 it’s not exactly brown. Dark wine aanu
 Priyanka: Right
 Meghana: Chinchu, I understand I haven’t given you a treat, I should have given you one long ago. Let’s go out for dinner day after tomorrow.
But it really hurts when Chinnu keeps saying that I don’t treat. I have treated and gifted everyone except Rahul Ettan and you when I got into Cisco. And I did not skimp on any of those, I gave everyone good treats, my parents, Abhi, velliachans, velliammas, Abhi and Swati. For Arjun’s, yes, I haven’t given a formal treat. But he had treated everyone at Bangalore on our way to Pondi, I thought that would suffice. There also you were not there. I really want to give you a treat. So let’s do that. But tbh, I don’t like how Chinnu keeps saying I haven’t treated at all. And each time she says it, she does it with too much vigour. It really hurts.
 Meghana: Also, for Arjun’s, there is an engagement function. But that also you’ll miss🙈 So for all of that let’s go out.
 Priyanka: Hey Meghu, chill. Unfortunately Chinnu chechi saw the long message as I was going to text the event planner and asked me what it was and since I didn’t know the content, we read it together. 
She was upset and vent out to me that it’s not that she wants a treat badly or anything, but CMU is a big big happy thing that happened in your life right. Every happy moment in our lives were celebrated with you guys. Anyways, don’t think a lot about it. Chuck it if you are running low on funds. It is usual for us sisters to keep nagging on each other.
 Meghana: It’s okay that she saw. Not a problem. Yes, nagging is chill, I like that. And I never felt anything when you asked. But every time this topic has come up(even in the past) she was a little aggressive and that really hurts. It’s like I haven’t treated at all.
