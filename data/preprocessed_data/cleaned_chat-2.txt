 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: No nap
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: If they want to they can
 Meghana: But That’s intrusion to privacy no?😮
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: They don't say anything to us
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: As long a work is give
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Done*
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: They actually don't care

 Meghana: I was panicking too much, I actually don’t remember what he said. He sent this first 🙄
After that I don’t remember what he sent. I was trying and justifying how that got sent😂
 Meghana: Should see what he sent now
 Meghana: Shit, he didn’t say much. He didn’t even laugh about it 😭 had he laughed I would have known he took it well
 Meghana: I sent screenshot of my keyboard n all, to show why I sent it
 Meghana: Then he said “please tell me this is the wrong chat”
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Should have just said wrong chat no 😂
 Meghana: I also thought if that later, but my mind wasn’t working da😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Why justify soo much
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Or say phone fell on face 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Best
 Meghana: I don’t know, this sticker looks too creepy for some reason 😂
 Meghana: Oh yeah, why did I not think of this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
 Meghana: Shit, that was funny😂😂
 Meghana: It’s going to be my go to from now
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 🙈
 Meghana: But lingerie can’t come from phone falling on face no😂

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I need a weekend
 Meghana: I know right
 Meghana: But this weekend came fast I feel
 Meghana: In my call just now I casually tried to push something to next week but PM caught that😪 he asked me to do it now itself😮
 Meghana: I thought he’d say tomorrow at least😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh no 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's sad
 Meghana: Aye no no, I’m not that devout an employee 🤭
Told him I’d finish by tomorrow’s night call
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Done?
 Meghana: Done done
 Meghana: Gaming?
 Meghana: On call with a friend, something weird happened 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Yeah 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Explain?
 Meghana: Oh, I don’t know why I said friend, it was cousin. My age but.
So she had sent me this connection request on LinkedIn today
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: And..
 Meghana: And as soon as I accepted here request a suggestion of this guy came up. And I couldn’t tell where, but I recognised him
 Meghana: Now I feel like the story is nothing 😂 but I’ll still say
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: No no go on
 Meghana: So I sent a request, there were quite a few mutual connections, but that’s because he studied in the same college as my friends from 11th and 12th.
And then I realised it was hinge where I recognised him from
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hahahhahahha 😂😂
 Meghana: When I had just joined we had matched , but hadn’t talked much n all
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Too good🙈
 Meghana: But I was still curious about how my cousin knew him
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hinge to LinkedIn🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂😂yeah
So I asked him how he knew Devu
 Meghana: And it seems they used to date 😮
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ohhh gossip
 Meghana: And I got excited for some reason 😂
 Meghana: So was talking to her😂
 Meghana: Yes😂😂
Not so much. This is all the story is😂
 Meghana: I just realised the story is nothing
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ayyo ok
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Not that bad also
 Meghana: Now I’m wondering why I got excited 🤔
 Meghana: And then she also told me she has been exploring these apps and has dated a lot of people in the past year 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's ok, getting excited for small things is nice🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh.. something I've never managed to do
 Meghana: Yes, especially because it’s corona n all, and I don’t have much of a life, these things are important events😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll talk for like 1 2 days that all 😂
 Meghana: Same same😂
 Meghana: Omg, same here😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Very important
 Meghana: Usually ends with hey 😂😂not even 2 days
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hahaha 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll take it past hey 🙈 but yeah 3 days max
 Meghana: Aye, this is like 3 weeks now
 Meghana: I’m guessing that’s a good thing?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Yes yes good thing 🙈
 Meghana: You on or off the hinge phase now?😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Off fully off
 Meghana: WhatsApp needs to include the option to like messages too
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 🙈
 Meghana: Gaming?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Just talking to friends
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Maybe I'll play one game?
 Meghana: Aye, life talks n all huh
 Meghana: Aren’t you tired from yesterday?😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I don't have much work tomorrow
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: So no problem
 Meghana: 😟
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Tomorrow I'll get my new ssd . I'll spend time setting that up
 Meghana: Oh😮
Sounds like a Good Friday
 Meghana: *good
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: For now Yes.. good Friday 😂
 Meghana: I need to do that thing I tried to postpone tomorrow. It needs docker n all, and I don’t even know docker😂
 Meghana: Should sit and figure out tomorrow
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's not to hard
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: You'll be fine
 Meghana: But it’s like this series of steps. We are sort of by passing the procedure in place now at Cisco.
So a lot of configs to be done
 Meghana: We currently have a CI/CD pipeline for the orchestration n all. But this new project can’t use that as it will lead to some unnecessary dependencies
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oohh fancy
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Also madam please don't use the roof as a slide 🙈
 Meghana: Aye🤭🙈
 Meghana: I’ll send you a pic of how that place actually is.

 Meghana: I have😭and I’m supposed to finish something by then😭
But I can’t even understand what’s going on here, my mind has shut down😭
 Meghana: I know right😑
 Meghana: I kept procrastinating also all day thinking when it’s almost time for the meeting I’d figure something out
 Meghana: But turns out I actually don’t care anymore 😭
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I am also doing one task that I've been procrastinating for 3 days now 😂
 Meghana: You done with work?
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂
 Meghana: See, that’s why they should give us a couple of weeks in between for me time n all
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll still do it last minute🙈🙈
 Meghana: No no, those weeks are not to work da😂😂
 Meghana: They are for us to relax
 Meghana: So that we’ll go back and work properly
 Meghana: To clear the mind n all

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh like that
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Yaa that might help 🙈
 Meghana: Yes😭
 Meghana: Too hypothetical but still
 Meghana: If I had been one of those senior leaders I’d have let all my employees take a break
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I have some 148hrs of holidays in my bucket
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I can technical take a month off 🙈

 Meghana: 1 month long?🤩🤩
 Meghana: Take no😪
 Meghana: Don’t they get exhausted after a point?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll take the ones that are getting exhausted by the end of this year
 Meghana: So many leaves do you get each monthV
 Meghana: *?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I get 2.5 days a month
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 1 sick and 1.5 privileged
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Sick expires at the end of the year
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Privileged I can encash or carry forward (upto 60days I can keep in that bucket)

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Sleep over yeah
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Booze maybe
 Meghana: Aye, this is exciting 🤩
 Meghana: My cousins met up in the US😭

 Meghana: They are making other plans while I’m on call😑😟
 Meghana: Show offs

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But you'll be part of it no?
 Meghana: No no , that’s the problem no😭😭

 Meghana: You think I’d have😂👀
 Meghana: Oh, this I think I can do. So what kind of gift are you looking for
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: What would someone our age want now , and that something should be gift-able
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Something a girl would want
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: What would you like to be gifted 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Don't think this much also da
 Meghana: Oh wait, let me think🤔
But wait, for this I need some background information about her.
I think I’d like a nice tote bag or something. That’s easy to choose.
What else would be a good option🤔
 Meghana: Aye, this needs some thinking, you wait da😂
 Meghana: But tomorrow is the birthday no?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll give her the gift later no issues
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Googling what a tote bag is .. wait
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Got it
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂this is cute
 Meghana: Oh, then I have time to think
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: ETA? 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ok wait one more important background info you need 😂
 Meghana: Tomorrow morning?👀
I’m thinking right now actually.
 Meghana: Tell tell
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: She is the college ex.. the one I'm good friends with 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: So no inappropriate gifts
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 12 and 1st year
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Not exactly college
 Meghana: Oh, good you told this😂
You are good friends with school ex no da?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But you get the point
 Meghana: Aah yes, this I remember
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Overlap 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Only of education years not girls
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Incase you were confused
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Can't date 2 people and all at the same time.. too much stress
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂oh God, that was funny
 Meghana: I did not think this😂😂
 Meghana: But wait, now I’m wondering why I did not think of it that way
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I was just being clear
 Meghana: 😂😂😵to remember all the lies itself seems like one big job
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Since you haven't met me, you might think I can date 2 people and all 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: My digital impression is all I've got rn🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂 good you cleared this then
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂so far so good but
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Thanks thanks 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Validation++
 Meghana: 😂😂you seem like a really nice person. I don’t think I’d have thought you’d date two people at once😂
 Meghana: Unless it was an open relationship n all
 Meghana: Then I don’t know, because I’ve never really understood how those work😵
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Usually I'm very confident in things I do.. cause I know and understand them. When it comes to girls and relationships I am generally a bit shy idk why.. it's always hard to place and understand some emotions 🙈
 Meghana: I figured this🙈
Is it like the idea of a relationship that you shy away from?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: No no
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Just inexperience I guess
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's a bit of an unknown no
 Meghana: Aye, you’ve had two long enough relationships no😮
 Meghana: That’s there🤔
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: See you take something like sports , I can practice every day play more and more game.. how to do that in a relationship 🙈 daily New relationship is a little hard no
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Every person is unique no
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: If I make a mistake today I'll fix and come back tomorrow. In a relationship that may not happen.. might not be a tomorrow to come back to no
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ooof.. too deep too deep
 Meghana: 😂😂😂daily new relationship it seems.
I don’t know who does this😂 why not work on the same one instead da?😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Let's move on to lighter topics 🙈
 Meghana: Yes😮😮 shit, that was deep
 Meghana: But there could be a tomorrow
 Meghana: Just with a different person
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I do , I mean I will.
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Always 🙈
 Meghana: So there is room for correction for sure
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂but we only tangentially touched this
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Tangent to full blown perpendicular doesn't take time 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But if you want to continue to talk about this , I don't mind 😌
 Meghana: Ahha, I’m  trying to understand the metaphor here
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Too geometric no 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂the geometry I understood, but that was about it
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: So if you drop a perpendicular to a tangent it passes through the center of the circle
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Tangentially touching to perpendicular ie just scratching to going right into the middle of the circle
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's what I was going for 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Leave it
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It was a little lame only 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Too nerdy
 Meghana: It was going above my head da😂
I tried re reading n all. But the time is not right. I’ll read this again in the morning. 
The math I understood though😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: It's ok. 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I think I'm sleepy , I'll attempt to sleep
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll text if I don't fall asleep
 Meghana: 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I've to be up at 9 :(
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I don't like that on a Sunday
 Meghana: Yes, I think I’ll be awake. No sleep since the past two days😭
 Meghana: Why?😮
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Some apartment meeting is there
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I've to go help them out
 Meghana: Oh😮shit, 9 sounds too early. Especially because it’s almost 3 and you are still awake😮

 Meghana: Face the fear😂
 Meghana: So I asked my PM when he thought would be a good time for me to do it
 Meghana: Because of work stuff
 Meghana: He suggested I finish it before the ResHat calls resume
 Meghana: I had actually thought of getting the procedure done after my GRE next week
 Meghana: But the RedHat engagement will start again on 21st

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh no wait wait
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I fully fucked my thumb in March
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Cricket

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Have you met your surgeon?
 Meghana: Not today. I don’t think he’s here yet.🤔
 Meghana: At 7:30 they’ll take me it seems
 Meghana: The nurse just came and told
 Meghana: Don’t know when I’ll be able to meet the surgeon
 Meghana: I actually had first met a doctor at Bangalore
 Meghana: Some time ago
 Meghana: I wanted to get it done by her
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh
 Meghana: Then because of the logistics she referred me to him since he’s here only
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But this is good
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Your parents are there with you
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: They will also be at peace
 Meghana: Parents are not giving me peace 😂
Dad went home last night because Abhi is alone at home. Mom stayed with me
 Meghana: Yeah, now they are I think
 Meghana: They keep asking me if I’m worried
 Meghana: And then I told them
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Paavam
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Let them be
 Meghana: That I’m very bold n all😂
And I usually smile a lot, so they know I’m okay
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I don't think we'll ever understand unless we are in their place
 Meghana: True, this I also thought . But this is a lot of worrying no😵
But I guess this sort of naturally comes
 Meghana: No matter how much we say we won’t be like them
 Meghana: I keep asking parents to be very selfish and think more about themselves
 Meghana: But they don’t 😑
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Generation gap 😂
 Meghana: I tell them also that they don’t have to feel guilty about this because I’m going to do this to my kids😂
 Meghana: Big one😂😂
But I’m sure we will all be like this eventually
 Meghana: When the time comes
 Meghana: But you know what I won’t like
 Meghana: My kids dating, I think I’ll get annoyed and possessive 😂😂
 Meghana: Especially if it’s a son
 Meghana: 😪😪😪😭😭
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I mean I will be a different parent to my child for sure. But that's not cause what my mom and dad is was wrong of anything.. just a different approach
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: This is going to be fun to watch 😂
 Meghana: Yeah, that yes, I keep telling parents also this all the time. But the worrying will always be there I guess
 Meghana: 😭😭it’s going to be very hurtful
 Meghana: I’m sure they’ll come home one day saying they’ve found one bitch😪
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Already soo judgemental 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Give the girl a chance no 🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂yes🤭
 Meghana: She has to be really good😪😪
I’ll think about this. But I just hope they don’t find anyone too soon
 Meghana: I feel really evil😂
 Meghana: But it’s okay🤭
 Meghana: I think if it’s a daughter she can date🤔
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Think about it like you are the girl and your boyfriend's mother doesn't give you a chance 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Then you'll understand
 Meghana: 😮😮😮😮😮
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Why this gender bias
 Meghana: Oh damn, no no no no😮😮 that will be horrible . Shit.
But yes, I think I’ll also eventually come around, but it will be hard to accept initially 😪😪😪or maybe I’ll just gel with her really well
 Meghana: I don’t understand either😂😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: In sure you'll eventually come around. It's just the initial emotion 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Im *
 Meghana: Yes, I think after some time I’ll just get used to the fact. Until then I’ll just eat up my sorrow😪
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Eat up my sorrow itseems 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Go rant to your husband
 Meghana: Then what😪
 Meghana: He better sit and listen😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I guess by that point he'll be good at it
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂
 Meghana: Yes yes, he’ll be used to it by then😂 but I won’t do that annoying rant I think
 Meghana: He better find it cute, else I’m dead😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hahaha 😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Do you switch language with you are really angry?
 Meghana: I do I do. Anything that affects me I speak about in English. As in at home, if I get emotional or if I’m angry I switch to English
 Meghana: You do too?
 Meghana: I usually speak in malayalam only to parents
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Depends who I'm angry with
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Yeah I speak in tamil only to mom and dad
 Meghana: 😂😂what are the different languages you switch to?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: If I'm angry with them one unique mixture is tamil and English will come
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Otherwise anger usually results in English
 Meghana: 😂😂😂this sounds fun and really cute
Only when angry or any kind of emotional state?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Now my parents will get up and yell at me for being up. So I'm going to close my eyes, if I sleep I'll sleep or else ill wake up in 30mins and pretend I woke up early 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Any heightened emotion
 Meghana: 😂😂awww
Yes, it’s really really early/late, I don’t think I can say late anymore
 Meghana: Get some sleepy
 Meghana: *sleep
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: All the best for your surgery! You'll do great!
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I'll text once I'm up 🤗

My God, yeah, I can look super weird in those also. Once in a while, very rarely I get lucky and get a pic

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: He's young and naive
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's why
 Meghana: 😂😂he is
Acting like a typical teenager
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😂😂😂
 Meghana: I full on judge teenagers these days😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Why da
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: You were one of them
 Meghana: I was not one of them😮
 Meghana: I was a nice teenager I think🤔
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Please explain
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: This also
 Meghana: Teenagers these days act like they are 25😑
 Meghana: I was a very nice innocent teenager 😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: What do they do? 😂
 Meghana: The way some of them act da😮
 Meghana: They are all like well kept n all😮
 Meghana: And the way they talk and act in general
 Meghana: 😮
 Meghana: And the kind of problems they have da😮
 Meghana: I’m jealous I think😂
 Meghana: I look homeless most of the times
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Homeless best!
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: No expectation
 Meghana: 😂😂aye, I can clean okayishly well too I guess
 Meghana: ^clean up
 Meghana: 😂😂😂this is good but
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: This is my logic with everything
 Meghana: It’s a wonderful logic. I try to be like this as well. But it’s hard to keep it that way
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: If people don't expect from you.. everything is considered good 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂
So you like put down expectations fully ?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Generally keep expectations low 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: But always give 100%
 Meghana: Yeah?😮
 Meghana: Doing that is not easy😮
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: You've to try no. If you don't try then you have only yourself to blame
 Meghana: Aah yes yes, I try n all
But to keep 0 expectations and give that much is hard right? 
As in, if that isn’t reciprocated even a little bit it’s hard right?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hmm.. I expect a lot of myself
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I make sure others don't expect too much
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: So disappointment is limited to me 😂
 Meghana: From you?
 Meghana: For other people right?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: This requires more explanation. 😂
 Meghana: My cousin is calling me for shopping😟I’m trying to fight my temptation now
 Meghana: Yes😂😂
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I make sure others don't expect much of me so whatever I do they aren't disappointed.
But I expect a lot out of myself so I'm almost always disappointed (not good , but sometimes motivating)
 Meghana: Oh yeah, I actually can totally relate to the second part.
What are you expectations from yourself?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Depends on what thing no? 😂

 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Oh no why
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Dude I slept off
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I woke up now
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Hihi! I've just become the hinge boy you used to talk to now 🙈
 Meghana: Hey hey
 Meghana: the only hinge boy I used to talk to actually 👀
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: And then stopped for some reason 🙈
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: (which I still don't know/understand)
 Meghana: We vibed really really well. Had mentioned to Manasa also about you. Even the call with you was extremely easy. Everything was great. Had deleted Hinge and everything.
But I didn’t know what our equation was. You did mention you were shy when it came to girls.
But meanwhile something happened. So remember I told you about the guy who almost dated my cousin. The guy and I got quite close after that. And I didn’t know what was happening between us(you and I) and I didn’t want to lead on because the other guy and I started getting close. 
But I still keep telling Manasa how well we had connected
 Meghana: 😢😢
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's fine. I mean we don't control what happens to us and when. 
You could have just told me, or asked me and I'd have told you where we stand. 
But it's cool, you let me know where you are right now and what you want to do. If you'd rather us not talk, that's also fine (will be a bit sad) but I respect that.
 Meghana: I wanted to ask you, but somehow the conversation never came up. So then I wondered what the equation was. 
No no, I’d love for us to talk. We connected very well. Communication gap came in the way.
But the other guy and I are very close. We are planning on dating and seeing how it goes.
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Understandable. I was just taking my time, given that you are back in Mysore and I'm here. But I'm glad you told me. ✌️
 Meghana: Yes, that I understand now. Shit. But since nothing on those lines came up in our conversations (my bad too, I should have brought it up) I thought it wasn’t happening.
So we won’t talk at all?
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: That's alright.
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Ayy no, I'd really like to still talk to you, if you are ok with it ofc
 Meghana: Yes yes, I’d love it too🤩
I’d really love for us to still talk
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: 😌
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Sure ✌️
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: Happy onam da!
 Meghana: Thank you so much 🙈
And same to you da
 Meghana: Put a very big flower rangoli this time
 ‪+91 87925 95641‬: I went to grandmoms house and ate and slept 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂sadhya?

 Meghana: *tbh
 Meghana: We tried watching a movie and all of us fell asleep
