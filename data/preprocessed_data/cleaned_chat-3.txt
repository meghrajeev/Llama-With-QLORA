 Arjun: It is with great sadness, that we share the news of the death of our dear friend Adarsh Nambiar . He had been in critical condition in the hospital in the U.S. for the past one week following a cardiac arrest, but did not manage to survive. May his soul rest in peace 🙏

 Meghana: Fuck
 Meghana: So young
 Meghana: For a cardiac arrest
 Meghana: Where in the US?
 Meghana: How old?
 Arjun: Texas
 Arjun: 28
 Arjun: I’m driving to the airport
 Arjun: Ping you later
 Meghana: 😍
 Meghana: Done
 Meghana: Why airport?
 Arjun: Singapore
 Meghana: These videos are 😍😍
 Meghana: Not Wednesday?
 Meghana: Things I want at the very list from my partner:
1. Someone who gets me
2. Someone who thinks they are lucky to be with me
3. Someone who appreciates me and my character and helps me become better, and not by finding fault all the time. Or insisting that everything is about my poor character.
5. Someone who has got my back no matter what.
6. Someone who understands that this is special and it does not happen everyday.
7. Someone who is kind and compassionate to me.
8. Someone I can both laugh and cry with, without being called dramatic.
 Arjun: I think I fit with all of these almost all the time. 

Any deviations are only partly my fault
 Meghana: I thought so too. That you fit most of these.
 Meghana: *least
 Arjun: Okay
 Meghana: You think everything that’s going wrong is because of my character.
You diss my character too often. Even when not necessary. I say I don’t have friends, oh it’s your character. I say I’m fighting with dad, you say “oh, it’s your character “. I say everything is okay and you say “no, something is wrong, it’s your character “.
 Meghana: And  this I think happens because you don’t fit any of the other 7 points
 Arjun: I don’t want to comment
 Arjun: I think this is extremely harsh
 Meghana: But it is what I feel.
 Meghana: And that’s why we can’t get ourselves to say any of these positive reaffirmations even when we are not fighting.
 Arjun: The positive affirmations are strong when we are not fighting
 Arjun: Don’t know why you never hear them
 Arjun: Vice versa has been lacking
 Meghana: They aren’t. It’s usually just the I love yous. Or I miss yous.
 Arjun: If you say so
 Arjun: This is taking for granted at an ultimate level
 Meghana: You can be in denial all you want.
 Arjun: I’ll never be enough for you
 Meghana: I agree too.
 Meghana: I feel the same. I don’t know what I can do to fit that Bill of an “ideal person”. Let alone girlfriend.
 Arjun: You’re overdoing this
 Meghana: I’m not. I can’t take digs at my character all the time
 Meghana: It’s all the time
 Arjun: But whatever. I don’t need to hear this
 Meghana: It’s because you don’t appreciate me.
 Meghana: Everything I do is a problem with my character.
 Arjun: Whatever
 Arjun: I don’t need to agree to all this crap
 Meghana: You don’t need to. It’s what you make the other person feel. Or not feel actually.
 Meghana: .
 Arjun: What can I do if the other person doesn’t value what I do for her? That nothing that I do would be enough?
 Meghana: They don’t matter as much when the very foundational things aren’t there. 
Also, I feel the same.
 Meghana: Nothing I do makes me a good person.
 Meghana: For everything, I’m the problem.
 Meghana: I’ve heard this more than words of appreciation from you over the last few months
 Meghana: That I’m the problem.
 Arjun: Sure
 Arjun: I can’t do this
 Arjun: This is very annoying
 Arjun: This is too much drama
 Arjun: I don’t need to hear this
 Meghana: Of course. Everything I do of dramatic
 Meghana: You will not appreciate me. Or respect me.
 Meghana: You can fight me about what I feel or accept that it’s the fact of the matter
 Arjun: Lol. How can you even say this
 Meghana: Because that’s why you think everything happens. Because my character is the problem.
 Arjun: I didn’t say this. You are
 Meghana: I’m not. You do it all the time. You make it about my character all the time.
 Meghana: You make me the problem.
 Arjun: Cool
 Meghana: If there had been some appreciation things would have been different.
 Arjun: Please stop 🙏🏻
 Meghana: These are things I feel. I can stop. But they don’t change anything.
 Arjun: Sure
 Meghana: You said loml last week. And that too because I asked you to.
 Meghana: I don’t say anything like that either. Because I don’t know if I truly feel all of that. I’m not blaming you for there not being positive reaffirmations.
 Meghana: But I really like them in a relationship. Don’t know if you remember, but when we started going out I had told it to you many times. That positive reaffirmation is like a love language for me.
 Arjun: The fuck
 Arjun: I call you LOML and soulmate all the time. Omg this is unbearable
 Arjun: Are you PMSing. Asking because you’re this unreasonable only during those days
 Arjun: This is beyond unreasonable
 Arjun: Ridiculous accusations
 Arjun: And conclusions
 Arjun: I can’t handle this shit
 Arjun: Fuck
 Arjun: You’re outright lying
 Arjun: You’re misrepresenting facts for gods sake
 Arjun: Making this look like a loveless relationship
 Arjun: What the fuck is wrong with you?
 Arjun: No positive affirmations it seems
 Arjun: This is psycho shit
 Arjun: Fuck
 Arjun: I can’t listen to all this crap and stay calm
 Meghana: Soulmate you do actually. My bad. And what about other positive reaffirmations? Things like I’m so lucky…
 Arjun: You can go fuck yourself
 Arjun: Don’t ping me
 Arjun: Don’t talk to me
 Arjun: I hate this
 Arjun: This is just plain fuckery
 Meghana: Sure.
 Arjun: You can’t go around saying all this crap
 Meghana: It’s not crap.
 Arjun: Your stupid fucking pressure tactic is not healthy for relationships
 Meghana: .
 Arjun: This is absolute crap
 Arjun: The way you’re blowing shit up. The way you’re lying. How ungrateful you are. My hod
 Arjun: God
 Meghana: This is not pressure tactic. There is no hidden intention here. My God.
 Arjun: Please leave me alone
 Arjun: Please fuck off
 Meghana: You can get pissed. But again, that doesn’t change much.
 Meghana: I am not lying about this. And I’m not lying when I say you don’t make me feel this way.
 Meghana: And you are that person who has hurt me the most in my life. And times when I cry because I am hurt, you call me over dramatic.
 Meghana: Love alone won’t help a relationship
 Meghana: And I think instead of running away from these we must face the fact and try to take action
 Meghana: ‎You deleted this message.
 Arjun: ?
 Meghana: Nothing
 Meghana: Wanted to send myself something. And this chat was the first thing that came to mind. Thought I was blocked anyway. So sent. Sorry.
 Arjun: I unblocked 10 min in
 Meghana: There were messages that I sent 2 hours later that didn’t reach you.
 Arjun: Oh that’s strange
 Arjun: Okay then maybe not 10 min in
 Meghana: Yeah
 Arjun: But yesterday itself.
 Arjun: These were probably not very pleasant
 Meghana: .
 Meghana: .
 Meghana: And I think instead of running away from these we must face the fact and try to take action
 Arjun: I still think this is a crazy unnecessary exaggeration.
 Arjun: And am hopeful that you’ll also see it like that after you calm down
 Arjun: So would wait for that
 Meghana: I don’t know.
 Meghana: I’m not exaggerating. I don’t want to call everything exaggeration and shove that under the rug.
 Arjun: I know for a fact that sooo many unnecessary parallels and extreme hyperboles were used
 Meghana: *them
 Meghana: And you should stop calling what I feel unnecessary exaggerations or pressure tactics.
 Meghana: They are not.
 Arjun: Your 8 point list for starters. You made this seem like an absolute loveless nightmare. I would like to believe that it’s not the case.

I would deny those accusations strongly.
 Arjun: Because that’s what it feels like. Not every fight or disagreement is a foundational issue
 Arjun: Not everything needs to question the foundations
 Arjun: That is Soo unfair
 Meghana: Once or twice a week you probably make me feel those. The rest of the days that’s not the case. And I don’t think it’s reasonable to be in a relationship like that. One that can break and fall any minute.
 Arjun: I am sorry that this episode has pushed you so far down that everything else seemed so bleak and pointless
 Arjun: I am sorry for making you feel like that momentarily
 Arjun: But momentarily! That’s the keyword. When you hit that low point you question everything! EVERYTHING. It’s so fucking hard to hear the kind of things you say when you’re in your low point
 Meghana: I hadn’t. I thought it was one fight too. But how many more of those can we have? How many of those can a couple have in a week before one of them loses sanity?
 Arjun: You generalise what you feel then to the entire relationship
 Meghana: Because what I feel then is what I feel on half of the days. And there is no stability. I was talking to you about dating a lot when I’m in Bangalore and all of that. That fight came out of nowhere.
 Arjun: O my sanity is pretty fucked too
 Meghana: I’m not denying and this is not a competition
 Arjun: Then you went on to say that there is no love anytime. There are no affirmations. There is only torture and compromise and suffering
 Arjun: Pointed out only because you said one of us lose sanity
 Meghana: I did not say any of that that day. Not even the next morning. I said that today. Two days later. 
I genuinely think that fight was completely uncalled for and there was no need for you to say everything that you said that day. Some of that was really hurtful. And I expect a sorry. Two days later also when it did not come I said these things.
 Meghana: My bad. Both of us*
 Arjun: You don’t have to paint such an ugly picture every time the going gets rough. You don’t need to lose complete faith so fast
 Arjun: What I said wasn’t uncalled for. The fight that followed was uncalled for
 Meghana: It’s not immediately after. It’s when two days after also that fight continued. And it was an extremely unnecessary fight. And it’s not like we fight once a month. This is every 2-3 days.
 Arjun: How is the things you said a warranted response for me not saying sorry?

Why is questioning the foundations the only way to share your displeasure?
 Meghana: The way you said it was completely uncalled for. There was absolutely no reason for you to have gotten that irritated. You or your family feeling that is no reason for you to tell me that I treat my family poorly.
 Arjun: The sorry was only about how I was stubborn about my reading of a situation and my insistence that you should check with your parents
 Arjun: Yeah and this nullifies our entire relationship?
 Arjun: This is a problem that needs addressing. I agree.

Does it nullify the love that we have? I don’t think so. At all
 Meghana: I questioned the foundations today. Because I don’t like how you reacted or the things you said. And you are too in over your head to realise that you didn’t have to say all that. For normal couples this is just a fight. For me this really was a tipping point.
 Meghana: Toxic fights over and over again nullifies the love in a relationship.
 Arjun: You question the foundations way too often. I will lose my shit every time you do that.
 Arjun: It doesn’t. It nullifies the possibility of love retaining. There’s a difference.

What you’re saying is that the love never existed. That’s not true and that’s not pleasant to hear.
 Meghana: I did not. I did not question the relationship. You did. On the day the fight started. And yesterday. I distinctly remember that I did not. On the way to office that day you shat all over the relationship. After a fight that you started.
 Meghana: I never said that love never existed.
 Arjun: Shitting over where the relationship stands at that point != saying that the whole relationship was fraud
 Meghana: I did not say love never existed.
 Meghana: Love is probably still there
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: That didn’t say love
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: That had no mention of love
 Arjun: .
 Arjun: It’s implying love
 Arjun: It’s implying the bare bones
 Meghana: My bad. Love is foundational. That’s there. Trust is not there. And a lot of other things that make a relationship worth it are not there.
 Meghana: I’m only talking with regards to that list
 Arjun: 👍🏼👍🏼
 Arjun: I think my stamina is out
 Meghana: Same.
 Arjun: Going cold is the only way I can protect myself
 Arjun: Bye
 Meghana: I agree. And that’s what I will do too.
 Meghana: Bye.
 Arjun: You’re the only person in the world who knows about my aspirations, my biggest vulnerabilities, my fears, my insecurities, even my goddamn gmat dates. I think I trust you.
 Arjun: But no. You have to nullify that
 Meghana: Then it’s my character that you probably don’t trust.
 Arjun: If you’re character was shit, I wouldn’t trust you with any of this
 Arjun: There are some actions of yours that I question
 Meghana: Then how come you shit all over it every chance you get?
 Arjun: That doesn’t mean that I don’t trust your character or you as a person. Omg
 Meghana: Like me being confident about something I know I didn’t do?
 Arjun: Every chance I get lol
 Arjun: Whatever
 Arjun: I said bye
 Arjun: Bye
 Meghana: I don’t want to fight either. I’m lost on how to fix this toxic cycle. I get that you want to go cold. 
I’ve been having a rough time figuring out how to deal with this whole thing too. I have confided in my parents  about all of this.
You should tell yours too. I think we should all sit and talk when I’m in India.
 Meghana: Again, this is not any kind of pressure tactic. You can go cold and distant if you want.
 Arjun: Great solutions
 Arjun: 👏🏼👏🏼
 Meghana: I’ve been walking around the last two days thinking it’s all over and trying to lift myself up. I can’t keep doing this. I’m really tired. Again, I know you are too.
 Arjun: I’ve never thought that it’s all over
 Arjun: Why do you have to go so extreme? Even to yourself
 Arjun: Like seriously, is there a PMS effect here?
 Arjun: But it’s too early for that no
 Meghana: Such relationships can’t sustain. We are too broken.
 Meghana: It’s not.
 Arjun: We are not too broken
 Meghana: Unless we both change completely for the good.
 Arjun: I don’t think so
 Arjun: This is why I feel it’s a pressure tactic. A hyperbole situation and calls for massive change
 Arjun: I don’t think it’s such a big deal and I don’t think we need massive rehaul
 Meghana: That’s my point. Such massive changes can’t happen. Which is why this is not wise
 Arjun: It’s not necessary!
 Arjun: O god
 Meghana: It is a big deal for me. It’s too much emotionally.
 Arjun: If you’re genuinely convinced that this is all a lie and it’s all fake and broken then yes take action as you deem fit. I’m probably ignorant
 Arjun: I don’t have any such foundational complaints
 Arjun: Except for this behavior of yours that blows up everything
 Meghana: Sure. If that’s what you think the problem is.
 Arjun: All the best then
 Arjun: Have a good one
 Arjun: Bye bye
 Meghana: I am not saying it’s all a lie. But I’m convinced that it is broken. I need some time to make a good sane  decision that I will not regret in the future.
 Arjun: What’s the update with Chinju?
 Arjun: How’s your throat?
 Meghana: Baby is not here yet
 Meghana: Still really hurts
 Arjun: Hmm
 Arjun: Okay
 Arjun: Take care
 Meghana: Bye
 Meghana: You are very ignorant. That’s why you feel that everything I feel and say is just pressure tactic or me being over dramatic.
 Meghana: They are not. They are genuine frustrations. I want to make sure that I’m not in the relationship for the wrong reasons. Which are-  the registration and family and all of that.
But that’s out of the way now. That’s another reason why I came clean to parents.
 Arjun: 👍🏼👍🏼
 Arjun: What did you find out?
 Meghana: I don’t know. Telling parents was to know if I had to worry that much shot the registration and family and all of that.
 Meghana: Now that they know about the situation I can more objectively think about it.
 Arjun: Ok
 Arjun: Lmk
 Meghana: It is not a decision to take in a day
 Meghana: If you think about it, even our trips are not peaceful
 Meghana: The times when couples are supposed to be all romantic and peaceful.
 Meghana: And like I said, that doc was supposed to be the hope that everything will be alright. Now I don’t know what that thing that gives me hope is
 Arjun: Ok
 Arjun: Make your decisions and let me know
 Arjun: Take your time
 Meghana: Thanks
 Arjun: Hope the throat is getting better
 Meghana: Still hurts. But it hurts less when visiting today
 Meghana: *coughing
 Meghana: Are you not scared that this will be our lives? Us Fighting all the time?
 Meghana: ?
 Arjun: Aah okay
 Arjun: Ofc I am
 Meghana: Then?
 Arjun: I can’t think of life without you
 Arjun: Even if it’s a life with these kind of unnecessary fights and disputes
 Meghana: But what is the point? Aren’t we missing out on a potentially better life?
 Arjun: I don’t know about you. As I said, I can’t picture a life without you
 Meghana: But life like this is miserable no?
 Arjun: Naah it’s miserable these 3-4 days
 Meghana: Out of 7 in a week
 Arjun: Otherwise I love being your partner
 Arjun: Nope out of 30 in a month
 Arjun: Hoping that number comes down
 Meghana: No. Our fights are much more frequent than that. We fought last week also. Right before you left for  Singapore
 Meghana: And the week before that
 Arjun: Even so
 Meghana: Why? How?
 Arjun: I don’t forget the good times
 Meghana: I don’t either.
 Meghana: But at some point you need to weigh them no
 Arjun: Then the why and the how is very easy
 Arjun: You may
 Meghana: I don’t know about that. There is no sign of anything getting better. If anything, it’s only getting worse with time. Making even the good times not as good as they used to seem.
 Arjun: I don’t feel so. The problems I’ve had with this relationship have always been the same. Yes I’m frustrated that it’s not getting better but I think I’m also getting used to it
 Meghana: That’s definition of toxic
 Arjun: I guess I’m okay with that. I have hope that it’ll get better
 Meghana: I’m not getting used to it. I don’t want to get used to it. These fights have major impact on life. You probably know how to handle your emotions well during the fights and focus on other things and get on with your day.
 Arjun: Also this is my personal opinion. Upto you on what your tolerance and plans are
 Arjun: Yeah I do
 Meghana: But I don’t. And I can’t be in that toxic cycle all my life
 Arjun: It’s not ideal but I can keep things separate. It’s a coping mechanism
 Arjun: I understand
 Arjun: I’ve been trying to get better for you. But if that’s not enough, I get it that you would want to take actions
 Meghana: I feel like there has not been a lot of change. The fights are still the same. During the fight you questioned the relationship. The mutual decision was to not do that again. And I feel like you do not understand me. I was genuinely hurt by everything you said that day. And you thought I was crying because I wanted to cause drama.
 Meghana: I can’t be with someone who doesn’t understand me. In those ways I’m jealous of Chinchu and Mahesh. Mahesh is a little regressive in his thoughts, but they have so much understanding and are so mindful of what each other is feeling
 Meghana: As soon as she cries he is just so compassionate with her. And so understanding of the fact that she’s hurt. Between us everything’s purely competitive
 Meghana: I can’t imagine a day where you’ll understand me when I’m actually crying, because of genuine emotions and you’ll pull me close and say that it will be okay.
 Meghana: Instead, you’ll shout at me and ask me to stop my drama.
 Arjun: I understand that you’re crying because you’re hurt. But my problem is that I genuinely feel that you’re the reason why you get hurt
 Arjun: The fact that you overthink and blow everything up in your head
 Arjun: I get helpless, sad and then I get impatient and cold
 Arjun: These episodes affect me too. So your overthinking is hurting both of us. That’s my understanding of what conspires
 Meghana: No, this fight for example. I don’t think I hurt myself.
 Meghana: That’s the problem, you get impatient too fast and go cold. I can’t deal with that
 Meghana: Your threshold with me for that is like 0
 Arjun: Yes you did. You blew up my concern and made it an existential question of me not trusting you. I was just trusting the very literal words your parents shared
 Arjun: It’s 0 because I’ve been stretched too thin
 Arjun: You turn every spark into a flame
 Meghana: And I told you that wasn’t the case. You could have believed me. You were here for 3 months. You saw the dynamic. Instead you started questioning my character.
 Meghana: I don’t think so. 
Also, I probably do this because you have too many complaints about my character.
 Arjun: What I saw during the 3 months kinda reinforced it. I saw you talk to Olu more than to your parents. You can argue that you were doing it for them. But when combined with what they said, I felt that it was a thing
 Arjun: Every complaint is not a character assassination attempt
 Meghana: You could have been wrong. There was no need to get irritated .
 Arjun: You have a million complaints about me. Have I ever raised this issue? That you are out to kill my character?
 Arjun: Maybe I am cold towards crying. I don’t trust crying
 Arjun: I think in most situations where you’ve cried, you’re the perpetrator
 Arjun: I’m being very candid here
 Meghana: When I usually raise complaints, they are about certain incidents. For example, asking for more calls/ communication. When  you make it my problem when your parents say things that are unwarranted. Etc. I think those are particular instances, I’ve not taken strikes over your character as a whole.
 Meghana: For a lot of things you in turn have directly gone to my character
 Meghana: *towards me crying
 Meghana: You know how to be sympathetic, just not towards me.
 Arjun: For more calls = you’re aloof, you don’t love me

Parents say things = you don’t love me, you will always pick them

These are hits on my character only
 Arjun: I’m sympathetic to you when I feel that you’re reasonable
 Meghana: I don’t say that you don’t love me. And I don’t find anything wrong in saying that you are aloof.
 Meghana: I have seen you pick them during multiple instances. And directly blame me for everything they said.
 Arjun: Sure
 Meghana: You don’t show half that respect here. Which is why you get triggered so easily. And make no attempt to understand.
 Arjun: Please think about this and let me know. My only hope is that you get more reasonable in these situations
 Arjun: You’ve stretched me too thin. It’s tough to understand when the claims on the other side are so extreme
 Meghana: I don’t know if this will change because we don’t agree. Even now you are blaming me for everything. I don’t need to agree to all of that.
 Meghana: It’s all you
 Meghana: I think we are done. Or at least, I’m done with you. Like I said, I don’t see any kind of appreciation.
 Meghana: It’s just fault after fault
 Arjun: 👍🏼👍🏼
 Arjun: I can pretend and agree to everything that you’re saying
 Arjun: I don’t want to do that
 Arjun: I hope you’ll come to your senses
 Meghana: You don’t need to pretend
 Arjun: And you’ll be more reasonable in how you’re approaching this
 Meghana: You don’t have to question my senses
 Meghana: I don’t like how you treat me.
 Meghana: That’s it.
 Arjun: Come to your senses != calling you crazy. It means when you’ll calm down and realize that you were overthinking
 Meghana: If you can’t show any kind of appreciation, respect or empathy then this is pointless
 Meghana: I disagree. Im not overthinking.
 Arjun: I do all of that and more. Not my problem if you’re oblivious to all of that
 Arjun: Okay. Suit yourself
 Arjun: I drop the ball when you’re unreasonable. And I don’t think that’ll change. I’m no saint
 Meghana: So I’m unreasonable all the time? I don’t think so.
 Arjun: Only when we are in these heated fights
 Meghana: This very fight for example. I was not unreasonable during this one and I stand by it.
 Arjun: I don’t think so
 Meghana: Okay, I don’t want to change how you feel about it.
 Meghana: I’ve told you what I feel.
 Meghana: I think you are too hot headed for me. I’ve seen you be patient. You make me sound like the most unreasonable person in the world. I don’t need to be made felt that by you. I need to keep my sanity.
 Meghana: Bye
 Arjun: Okay bye
 Meghana: This is the thing, nowhere, even in this conversation I don’t see any kind of appreciation. It’s just “you are unreasonable”
 Meghana: I’m very tired of this
 Arjun: How am I supposed to be appreciative here?
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: You don’t need to be appreciative. But this is just calling me unreasonable.
 Arjun: .
 Arjun: That’s what I’m trying to convey
 Meghana: That’s the thing. This is very hard to believe
 Arjun: Okay
 Meghana: Because of everything else you say
 Arjun: Okay
 Meghana: I don’t think everything that’s going wrong is because of me being unreasonable
 Arjun: Ofcourse not
 Arjun: I’m a hot head
 Arjun: But my biggest issue is you being unreasonable
 Meghana: I can’t tolerate your temper and be expected to be reasonable
 Arjun: I can be Gandhi and stay calm and understanding. But when these two terrible traits clash, we have miserable fights
 Arjun: I can’t tolerate how unreasonable you get and not lose my temper
 Arjun: Catch 22
 Arjun: Actually not
 Arjun: One of us gets better, the loop is broken
 Arjun: Both of us are weak pathetic humans
 Meghana: This time I was reasonable. You lost your temper for nothing
 Arjun: Nope
 Meghana: I told you I didn’t want anyone making unnecessary over analysis.
 Meghana: You got irritated
 Meghana: But I think it’s a fair ask
 Arjun: You made it bigger than what it was
 Meghana: How?
 Arjun: You weren’t ready to accept that there was a problem
 Arjun: At the Blaze dinner. Text you after?
 Meghana: Sure
 Meghana: Yes, because I was certain there wasn’t. If I had to be that confident there probably had to be a reason?
When my parents said that during the internship phase I took your feedback, I did not deny it then if you remember. I knew I was calling home less.
 Meghana: And I certainly didn’t like the thing you said about how everyone at home felt so. I don’t need to accept something just because it was discussed there.
 Meghana: You can get pissed all you want for saying this
 Meghana: Also, how come you have the tolerance when they say things? How come it matters to you when they cry? How come you don’t lose temper like the way you lose with me? How come you don’t shout like the way you shout at me?
Have they never been unreasonable? 
Asking because we all matter equally to you.
 Arjun: I call out unreasonable behavior whoever it is. I lose my temper whenever it’s due and unfortunately in some cases where it’s not due also. 

There is no partiality
 Arjun: You all matter equal to me. Period
 Meghana: No, this kind of shouting happens only here.
 Meghana: Your parents have said so. That you get annoyed. But no shouting
 Meghana: I believe I deserve the same kind of respect
 Meghana: What’s with the thumbs up?
 Arjun: Easier way to say okay
 Meghana: Sure. Disrespectful
 Meghana: Do whatever you want. Making it real easy to let this all go.
 Arjun: Sure
 Arjun: 👍🏼
 Meghana: What you are doing is really disrespectful
 Arjun: ‎Missed video call
 Arjun: Accident
 Arjun: The call
 Meghana: I KNOW
 Arjun: Sure
 Arjun: Chinju labour room keri le
 Meghana: I didn’t know this 😮😮
 Meghana: Last spoke to them at 9pm
 Meghana: Happened after?
 Arjun: Guess so
 Arjun: Amma told me
 Arjun: I think they consulted with her
 Meghana: Yeah they did
 Arjun: Any news?
 Meghana: Nope. Nothing yet. Had called Mahesh at 8 and he said doctor was supposed to come at 7 and that she was fully dilated.
 Meghana: And that whenever the doctor came they’d start
 Meghana: Nothing after that
 Arjun: Oh okay cool cool
 Arjun: Did you hear back from BNY?
 Arjun: My work hours are changing from 1-10 from next Wednesday
 Meghana: Yesterday
 Meghana: Oh, that’s good. Traffic also won’t be a problem then
 Arjun: What did they say?
 Arjun: Yeah and I can finish off calls in office. Mornings will be undisturbed
 Meghana: June 3rd joining. And some documents and all of that
 Meghana: Background check
 Meghana: Etc etc
 Meghana: Yeah, that’s convenient
 Arjun: Yep yep
 Arjun: Chinju no updates?
 Meghana: No
 Meghana: Baby is here
 Meghana: Just got to know
 Arjun: 😍😍😍😍
 Arjun: Congrats Meghu aunty
 Meghana: Not aunty
 Meghana: Should decide want I want to be called🤔
 Meghana: But thanks🤩🤩
 Arjun: Haha 🥰
 Arjun: The photo is too precious
 Meghana: Yeah, I’ve saved it
 Meghana: It’s toooo precious
 Meghana: Can’t believe how beautiful the human body is
 Meghana: And the baby is just sleeping on her
 Meghana: It’s too precious
 Meghana: And the new parents
 Arjun: Yeah 🥰
 Arjun: Chinnu Sushant erangiyo? 🙈
 Meghana: I asked amma the same thing today😂
 Meghana: The way the baby is just opening his eyes and lying there
 Arjun: 🥰
 Meghana: What do we do about us?
 Arjun: I thought you were evaluating at your end
 Meghana: I want some sign. That it will be better
 Meghana: ?
 Arjun: For me, the clarity that all of this was unnecessary and was just a product of our egos, that I get a day after a fight is more than enough sign
 Arjun: When I’m calm and not triggered, I don’t have any problems with you
 Meghana: Fighting so frequently is not okay
 Meghana: That’s the problem. You get triggered too fast
 Arjun: I agree
 Arjun: Because you’re unreasonable a lot
 Meghana: Sure
 Arjun: I agree that I get triggered too fast
 Meghana: I don’t know
 Meghana: It’s like every time I  talk to you I realise why I don’t want to.
 Meghana: Good day
 Meghana: Bye
 Arjun: Goodnight bye
 Arjun: I don’t get it. This is the exact thing I’ve been maintaining over the last 3 days. Do you expect me to change my narrative? Isn’t accepting that this is a big problem for me, the easier solve?
 Arjun: I am not denying my short temper or the fact that I get triggered too fast
 Arjun: Why is it so difficult for you to accept your flaws?
 Arjun: It’s statements like this that make it so easy for me to not talk
 Arjun: Extreme negativity
 Meghana: I am sometimes. Not a lot. For example this fight. I strongly believe I wasn’t unreasonable. The last big fight was on Onam. I told you that I thought what Amma said was unnecessary. You immediately got irritated. Lost temper just like that.
 Meghana: I wasn’t saying that simply. I really felt that. Which is why I kept my phone aside and tried to sleep. I heard the notifications, but didn’t feel like talking
 Meghana: There was no exaggeration there.
 Meghana: It’s not. You hadn’t agreed at about your temper first. That came later.
 Meghana: So it looked like you were putting the entire blame on me
 Meghana: That you only lose temper because I’m unreasonable
 Meghana: I have more examples. Every time I asked for more communication or calls you’d immediately call my clingy and what not. Our very first fight was also regarding that. You’d call for like 10 minutes every day while in the car, cut my calls while I was speaking. I said I needed more communication/ video calls and you called me clingy
 Meghana: That was hurtful
 Meghana: And it took you a year and a half to realise that asking for more communication is not such a bad thing
 Arjun: Okay, so?
 Arjun: Okay
 Arjun: That means you needn’t accept your flaws?
 Meghana: That felt like you were making me the problem and that felt like you had some big problems with me.
 Arjun: Okay
 Arjun: When will you get it
 Arjun: I am not getting anything ‘by making you the problem’
 Meghana: .
 Meghana: Like I said, I don’t feel appreciated. And there are the million problems
 Arjun: Okay cool cool
 Meghana: *then there
 Arjun: Whatever
 Meghana: Sure
 Arjun: Have a good day
 Meghana: You too
 Meghana: Why don’t you get it. Lately this relationship has been all about the flaws
 Meghana: That’s why even with nothing is wrong they come up
 Meghana: Also, this is a problem. I’m not supposed to raise any concerns or complaints. You get triggered just like that.
 Meghana: How do I get through to you
 Meghana: ?
 Arjun: I don’t get triggered all the time. It’s mostly only when you make unnecessary accusations and unreasonable exaggeration’s
 Meghana: Now that I think of it, I can’t remember a single concern that you immediately addressed
 Arjun: Sure
 Arjun: Extreme
 Meghana: No. I don’t agree. I asked for video calls or not but the call when I’m talking. You called me clingy. I don’t see any unnecessary accusation there
 Arjun: Whatever. I don’t want to ruin my day justifying and defending
 Arjun: Move on for gods sake. This is from a year ago
 Meghana: You did not take any action about what I felt about Aslamah for a VERY long time. Do not see anything unnecessary there
 Meghana: So what. These are examples
 Arjun: Step away from your arsenal of accusations
 Arjun: Of complaints
 Arjun: It’s so difficult
 Meghana: Sure. Just be hurt
 Meghana: I agree
 Meghana: It is
 Meghana: It is very difficult
 Arjun: You have too many unresolved issues
 Arjun: You’ll never move on
 Meghana: I don’t. These issues are resolved
 Arjun: Sure
 Arjun: None of it is
 Meghana: I said them now to show you how not everything was unnecessary
 Meghana: You called my complaints unnecessary
 Arjun: No issue is resolved for Meghana
 Meghana: Sure
 Arjun: Whatever
 Meghana: Yeah
 Meghana: Bye
 Arjun: Take your break no
 Arjun: I have started studying peacefully these days because I am not wasting time fighting with you
 Meghana: You are mr right. You are mr. perfect. It’s impossible for anyone to have any concerns with you.
 Meghana: Same. I have been very productive too
 Arjun: Thanks
 Arjun: Perfect. We should keep it this way
 Meghana: I agree.
 Meghana: And btw, this time I did not even have any concern. You got irritated because you have pre assumptions about my character that you needed me to accept
 Arjun: Whatever you say
 Meghana: I said nothing was wrong at home
 Meghana: You got irritated
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: Sure
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: Also, I can’t live without you it seems. Don’t give me that crap again.
 Meghana: You are right. Let’s just go back to not talking. I liked that better too
 Arjun: .
 Meghana: Block me or whatever
 Meghana: You are too disrespectful
 Arjun: 👍🏼
 Meghana: And you think it’s my problem when I say this relationship is not right.
 Meghana: You can act however you want, say whatever you want
 Meghana: But I’m the problem
 Arjun: 🙏🏻🙏🏻
 Meghana: My bad, texting you was a mistake
 Meghana: Will just move on.
 Arjun: 🙏🏻
 Arjun: There was no intention to solve anything
 Meghana: There was. I have my flaws, agree. But I don’t agree with how you invalidate every concern of mine saying it’s just me being unreasonable.
 Meghana: I’m not a perfect person. I more than agree with that.
 Meghana: A lot of the fights have escalated unnecessarily because of things I said. I agree.
 Meghana: But that doesn’t mean I need to own up to everything. For example this one. I don’t think I did anything wrong. I felt that to be an unnecessary accusation.
 Meghana: Like I said, I feel like the relationship has become all about the flaws
 Meghana: And I want that to change
 Meghana: And I want us to fight less
 Meghana: I want us, both of us to get triggered less
 Arjun: Hmm
 Meghana: I want both of us to be more understanding
 Arjun: This one did escalate because you didn’t trust my intentions
 Meghana: I want both of us to be more appreciative of the other person
 Arjun: I want all of these too
 Meghana: Because you were very stubborn about the accusation. Don’t you see it, my parents have no problem with me about how I communicate with them. At least at the moment they don’t
 Meghana: Then accept that the accusation was unnecessary no
 Meghana: Things I said the following day I think was unnecessary
 Meghana: I was disappointed about the fight and how you reacted after. Like on the call when you were on your way to the office
 Arjun: I took back the accusation but then you latched onto it. The whole over assume thing. My parents you parents thing
 Meghana: It was. I still think that that analysis was unnecessary. Some things are said just as fun. Not everything should be read like that. Even if they are, that could be wrong. You were not open to that possibility.
 Arjun: It is very unusual, what your parents said
 Arjun: You can’t blame for thinking otherwise
 Meghana: It’s not. They tell that to me also. Oh, Olunu oru phone vaangichu kodukkanam and all of that.
 Meghana: The interpretations were wrong.
 Arjun: What are you saying. The interpretations were warranted
 Meghana: And you extrapolated that to everything from before which also I felt was unnecessary
 Arjun: It was literal
 Meghana: They did not cry for help.
 Arjun: That’s figurative obviously
 Meghana: I know. But what they said was nothing like that.
 Arjun: It’s like Achamma saying “Ajunode anveshanam parayu” when she feels that I haven’t called her in a while
 Meghana: This doesn’t need to be like that no.
 Arjun: That’s the first interpretation anyone would make
 Meghana: Next time don’t make no. Why are things said over conversations discussed after? Entho thamashekku paranju, kazhinju.
 Meghana: About the internship times also wrong conclusions were made.
 Arjun: Yeah not reading into anything or doing anything proactively ever again
 Meghana: You can tell me if you did feel anything like that. If it’s not a concern I’ll tell you it isn’t.
 Meghana: Like I said. During the internship time I did not argue
 Meghana: I took the feedback
 Meghana: I did not fight
 Meghana: And I told you why I was calling home less
 Meghana: Trust me more no
 Arjun: Trust my intentions more no
 Meghana: You would not have gotten so annoyed when I disregarded what you said. I told you why that was not a concern and you got irritated. And you brought the internship thing and everything else
 Meghana: If the intention was to convey that, you would have done exactly that and not accused like you did. And to bolster that you brought in the family feeling and having discussed it thing also.
 Meghana: I have talked to my parents also. To not say anything even if they mean it as a joke. They will be more careful with what they say.
 Arjun: I had to illustrate why I had my suspicions
 Arjun: This was not necessary
 Meghana: They were unnecessary. I speak to my parents way too much.
 Meghana: This is. Because things are being discussed and interpretations are being made. And I’m being unnecessarily accused basis that. And we end up fighting.
 Meghana: You can’t deny this.
 Meghana: And this is not the first time. During the internship time also. I tell you things. But I did not expect you to tell them to your parents word to word. And they spoke about that to my parents. And my parents seemed clueless and again interpretations were made. But there was a reason I didn’t tell them everything about the internship search.
 Meghana: I don’t want these things to happen again. So this.
 Arjun: Okay cool
 Arjun: Good that there’s some semblance of peace
 Arjun: I’m not ready to hug it out tho
 Meghana: Same. I’m not ready either. And we shouldn’t do it also.
 Meghana: We both really need to think hard about how we can keep this as sacred as it should be.
 Meghana: And how we can change ourselves for that. To also accommodate the other person’s concerns.
 Meghana: Even if all of that takes some time
 Meghana: Even if it takes a few days to actually realise each others worth.
 Arjun: I agree
 Arjun: Agreed
 Arjun: Glad. Very
 Meghana: Same.
 Arjun: Good morning
 Meghana: Good morning
