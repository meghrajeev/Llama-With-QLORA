 Meghana: But That’s intrusion to privacy no?😮
 Varun: They don't say anything to us
 Varun: As long a work is give
 Varun: Done*
 Varun: They actually don't care
 Meghana: Webex says that Cisco Keeps all our messages and will have access to them and may even go through them it seems😂
 Meghana: So scary
 Meghana: 😵
 Meghana: Shit , I just sent some weird emoji to my cousin’s fiancé😵
‎ Meghana: ‎sticker omitted
 Meghana: I sent this by mistake 😂😂
 Meghana: And now he’s all weirded out
 Meghana: 😂
 Varun: Hahahhahahha 😂😂😂
 Varun: Toooo funny 😂
 Varun: What did he say?
 Meghana: I was a big creep today, don’t know what I was thinking 😵
So he asked me for an idea for a gift, and I said lingerie out of everything else possible
 Meghana: And then next thing I sent was this emoji
 Meghana: I am so stupid😂😵
 Varun: Omg 😂😂😂
 Varun: I want to know how he reacted 🙈
 Meghana: I was panicking too much, I actually don’t remember what he said. He sent this first 🙄
After that I don’t remember what he sent. I was trying and justifying how that got sent😂
 Meghana: Should see what he sent now
 Meghana: Shit, he didn’t say much. He didn’t even laugh about it 😭 had he laughed I would have known he took it well
 Meghana: I sent screenshot of my keyboard n all, to show why I sent it
 Meghana: Then he said “please tell me this is the wrong chat”
 Varun: Should have just said wrong chat no 😂
 Meghana: I also thought if that later, but my mind wasn’t working da😂
 Varun: Why justify soo much
 Varun: Or say phone fell on face 😂
 Varun: Best
 Meghana: I don’t know, this sticker looks too creepy for some reason 😂
 Meghana: Oh yeah, why did I not think of this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
 Meghana: Shit, that was funny😂😂
 Meghana: It’s going to be my go to from now
 Varun: 🙈
 Meghana: But lingerie can’t come from phone falling on face no😂
 Varun: True 😂
 Meghana: Because it’s like this arranged marriage thing, and I’m trying to be all decent😂
 Varun: Not going great so far 😂😂
 Meghana: Yes😓😂
 Meghana: One creep I’m now😂
 Varun: Funny creep 🙈
 Meghana: 😂🙈🤭
Funny is good, hope it’s that
 Meghana: But my uncle and aunt da, they had told me to be nice and decent first itself😂
 Meghana: Not in a serious way though😂
 Meghana: Done with work?
 Varun: Yeah kind of
 Varun: Need to do one more thing
 Meghana: Is Vidhant coming this weekend?
 Meghana: I can’t wait for Friday😭
 Varun: Idk I'll have to check
 Varun: Yaaa
 Varun: I need a weekend
 Meghana: I know right
 Meghana: But this weekend came fast I feel
 Meghana: In my call just now I casually tried to push something to next week but PM caught that😪 he asked me to do it now itself😮
 Meghana: I thought he’d say tomorrow at least😂
 Varun: Oh no 🙈
 Varun: That's sad
 Meghana: Aye no no, I’m not that devout an employee 🤭
Told him I’d finish by tomorrow’s night call
 Varun: Done?
 Meghana: Done done
 Meghana: Gaming?
 Meghana: On call with a friend, something weird happened 😂
 Varun: Yeah 🙈
 Varun: Explain?
 Meghana: Oh, I don’t know why I said friend, it was cousin. My age but.
So she had sent me this connection request on LinkedIn today
 Varun: And..
 Meghana: And as soon as I accepted here request a suggestion of this guy came up. And I couldn’t tell where, but I recognised him
 Meghana: Now I feel like the story is nothing 😂 but I’ll still say
 Varun: No no go on
 Meghana: So I sent a request, there were quite a few mutual connections, but that’s because he studied in the same college as my friends from 11th and 12th.
And then I realised it was hinge where I recognised him from
 Varun: Hahahhahahha 😂😂
 Meghana: When I had just joined we had matched , but hadn’t talked much n all
 Varun: Too good🙈
 Meghana: But I was still curious about how my cousin knew him
 Varun: Hinge to LinkedIn🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂😂yeah
So I asked him how he knew Devu
 Meghana: And it seems they used to date 😮
 Varun: Ohhh gossip
 Meghana: And I got excited for some reason 😂
 Meghana: So was talking to her😂
 Meghana: Yes😂😂
Not so much. This is all the story is😂
 Meghana: I just realised the story is nothing
 Varun: Ayyo ok
 Varun: Not that bad also
 Meghana: Now I’m wondering why I got excited 🤔
 Meghana: And then she also told me she has been exploring these apps and has dated a lot of people in the past year 😂
 Varun: It's ok, getting excited for small things is nice🙈
 Varun: Oh.. something I've never managed to do
 Meghana: Yes, especially because it’s corona n all, and I don’t have much of a life, these things are important events😂
 Varun: I'll talk for like 1 2 days that all 😂
 Meghana: Same same😂
 Meghana: Omg, same here😂
 Varun: Very important
 Meghana: Usually ends with hey 😂😂not even 2 days
 Varun: Hahaha 😂
 Varun: I'll take it past hey 🙈 but yeah 3 days max
 Meghana: Aye, this is like 3 weeks now
 Meghana: I’m guessing that’s a good thing?
 Varun: Yes yes good thing 🙈
 Meghana: You on or off the hinge phase now?😂
 Varun: Off fully off
 Meghana: WhatsApp needs to include the option to like messages too
 Varun: 🙈
 Meghana: Gaming?
 Varun: Just talking to friends
 Varun: Maybe I'll play one game?
 Meghana: Aye, life talks n all huh
 Meghana: Aren’t you tired from yesterday?😂
 Varun: I don't have much work tomorrow
 Varun: So no problem
 Meghana: 😟
 Varun: Tomorrow I'll get my new ssd . I'll spend time setting that up
 Meghana: Oh😮
Sounds like a Good Friday
 Meghana: *good
 Varun: For now Yes.. good Friday 😂
 Meghana: I need to do that thing I tried to postpone tomorrow. It needs docker n all, and I don’t even know docker😂
 Meghana: Should sit and figure out tomorrow
 Varun: It's not to hard
 Varun: You'll be fine
 Meghana: But it’s like this series of steps. We are sort of by passing the procedure in place now at Cisco.
So a lot of configs to be done
 Meghana: We currently have a CI/CD pipeline for the orchestration n all. But this new project can’t use that as it will lead to some unnecessary dependencies
 Varun: Oohh fancy
 Varun: Also madam please don't use the roof as a slide 🙈
 Meghana: Aye🤭🙈
 Meghana: I’ll send you a pic of how that place actually is.
‎ Meghana: ‎image omitted

 Varun: Ayyo
 Varun: All this happens only in Friday no
 Meghana: I have😭and I’m supposed to finish something by then😭
But I can’t even understand what’s going on here, my mind has shut down😭
 Meghana: I know right😑
 Meghana: I kept procrastinating also all day thinking when it’s almost time for the meeting I’d figure something out
 Meghana: But turns out I actually don’t care anymore 😭
 Varun: I am also doing one task that I've been procrastinating for 3 days now 😂
 Meghana: You done with work?
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
 Varun: 😂
 Meghana: See, that’s why they should give us a couple of weeks in between for me time n all
 Varun: I'll still do it last minute🙈🙈
 Meghana: No no, those weeks are not to work da😂😂
 Meghana: They are for us to relax
 Meghana: So that we’ll go back and work properly
 Meghana: To clear the mind n all
 Meghana: 😂
 Varun: Oh like that
 Varun: Yaa that might help 🙈
 Meghana: Yes😭
 Meghana: Too hypothetical but still
 Meghana: If I had been one of those senior leaders I’d have let all my employees take a break
 Varun: I have some 148hrs of holidays in my bucket
 Varun: I can technical take a month off 🙈
 Varun: 1 day is 8hrs
 Meghana: Omg😮😮tell me why you aren’t taking that again
 Varun: I usually take one long Christmas vacation🙈
 Varun: This is too long .. I'll have to take some now
 Meghana: 1 month long?🤩🤩
 Meghana: Take no😪
 Meghana: Don’t they get exhausted after a point?
 Varun: I'll take the ones that are getting exhausted by the end of this year
 Meghana: So many leaves do you get each monthV
 Meghana: *?
 Varun: I get 2.5 days a month
 Varun: 1 sick and 1.5 privileged
 Varun: Sick expires at the end of the year
 Varun: Privileged I can encash or carry forward (upto 60days I can keep in that bucket)
 Meghana: Oh yes, same here. But how come I don’t have so many leaves left😮
 Meghana: 60 days, aye, that’s a lot you can accumulate
 Meghana: Yay, weekend has finally come🙈
 Varun: Yaas!

 Meghana: Booze night and Sleep over n all?
 Varun: Sleep over yeah
 Varun: Booze maybe

 Meghana: My cousins met up in the US😭
Now they are calling and showing off😭
 Meghana: They are making other plans while I’m on call😑😟
 Meghana: Show offs
 Varun: You get on a video call
 Meghana: I am on a video call only 😭
That’s worse no🤔
 Varun: But you'll be part of it no?
 Meghana: No no , that’s the problem no😭😭
 Meghana: I’m not part of any of those😪 I’m here no😪
 Varun: Awake?
 Varun: Ayy
 Meghana: Watching the match. But it is kind of pointless now😪
 Varun: You are 😂
 Meghana: Very😂
Wasn’t sleepy, so came downstairs to watch😂
 Varun: Yeah. I am back in bed 🙈
 Varun: What sunday plans?
 Varun: Also I need gift suggestions 🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂😂I think I should go back too, but I’m not even sleepy😭
 Meghana: You think I’d have😂👀
 Meghana: Oh, this I think I can do. So what kind of gift are you looking for
 Varun: What would someone our age want now , and that something should be gift-able
 Varun: Something a girl would want
 Varun: What would you like to be gifted 🙈
 Varun: Don't think this much also da
 Meghana: Oh wait, let me think🤔
But wait, for this I need some background information about her.
I think I’d like a nice tote bag or something. That’s easy to choose.
What else would be a good option🤔
 Meghana: Aye, this needs some thinking, you wait da😂
 Meghana: But tomorrow is the birthday no?
 Varun: I'll give her the gift later no issues
 Varun: Googling what a tote bag is .. wait
 Varun: Got it
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂this is cute
 Meghana: Oh, then I have time to think
 Varun: ETA? 🙈
 Varun: Ok wait one more important background info you need 😂
 Meghana: Tomorrow morning?👀
I’m thinking right now actually.
 Meghana: Tell tell
 Varun: She is the college ex.. the one I'm good friends with 😂
 Varun: So no inappropriate gifts
 Varun: 12 and 1st year
 Varun: Not exactly college
 Meghana: Oh, good you told this😂
You are good friends with school ex no da?
 Varun: But you get the point
 Meghana: Aah yes, this I remember
 Varun: Overlap 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂
 Varun: Only of education years not girls
 Varun: Incase you were confused
 Varun: Can't date 2 people and all at the same time.. too much stress
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂oh God, that was funny
 Meghana: I did not think this😂😂
 Meghana: But wait, now I’m wondering why I did not think of it that way
 Varun: I was just being clear
 Meghana: 😂😂😵to remember all the lies itself seems like one big job
 Varun: Since you haven't met me, you might think I can date 2 people and all 🙈
 Varun: My digital impression is all I've got rn🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂 good you cleared this then
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂so far so good but
 Varun: Thanks thanks 🙈
 Varun: Validation++
 Meghana: 😂😂you seem like a really nice person. I don’t think I’d have thought you’d date two people at once😂
 Meghana: Unless it was an open relationship n all
 Meghana: Then I don’t know, because I’ve never really understood how those work😵
 Varun: Usually I'm very confident in things I do.. cause I know and understand them. When it comes to girls and relationships I am generally a bit shy idk why.. it's always hard to place and understand some emotions 🙈
 Meghana: I figured this🙈
Is it like the idea of a relationship that you shy away from?
 Varun: No no
 Varun: Just inexperience I guess
 Varun: It's a bit of an unknown no
 Meghana: Aye, you’ve had two long enough relationships no😮
 Meghana: That’s there🤔
 Varun: See you take something like sports , I can practice every day play more and more game.. how to do that in a relationship 🙈 daily New relationship is a little hard no
 Varun: Every person is unique no
 Varun: If I make a mistake today I'll fix and come back tomorrow. In a relationship that may not happen.. might not be a tomorrow to come back to no
 Varun: Ooof.. too deep too deep
 Meghana: 😂😂😂daily new relationship it seems.
I don’t know who does this😂 why not work on the same one instead da?😂
 Varun: Let's move on to lighter topics 🙈
 Meghana: Yes😮😮 shit, that was deep
 Meghana: But there could be a tomorrow
 Meghana: Just with a different person
 Varun: I do , I mean I will.
 Varun: Always 🙈
 Meghana: So there is room for correction for sure
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂but we only tangentially touched this
 Varun: Tangent to full blown perpendicular doesn't take time 🙈
 Varun: But if you want to continue to talk about this , I don't mind 😌
 Meghana: Ahha, I’m  trying to understand the metaphor here
 Varun: Too geometric no 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂the geometry I understood, but that was about it
 Varun: So if you drop a perpendicular to a tangent it passes through the center of the circle
 Varun: Tangentially touching to perpendicular ie just scratching to going right into the middle of the circle
 Varun: That's what I was going for 🙈
 Varun: Leave it
 Varun: It was a little lame only 😂😂
 Varun: Too nerdy
 Meghana: It was going above my head da😂
I tried re reading n all. But the time is not right. I’ll read this again in the morning. 
The math I understood though😂
 Varun: It's ok. 😂😂
 Varun: I think I'm sleepy , I'll attempt to sleep
 Varun: I'll text if I don't fall asleep
 Meghana: 😂😂
 Varun: I've to be up at 9 :(
 Varun: I don't like that on a Sunday
 Meghana: Yes, I think I’ll be awake. No sleep since the past two days😭
 Meghana: Why?😮
 Varun: Some apartment meeting is there
 Varun: I've to go help them out
 Meghana: Oh😮shit, 9 sounds too early. Especially because it’s almost 3 and you are still awake😮
 Varun: Yaa

 Meghana: Yes yes yes
 Varun: Not yet
 Varun: 11
 Meghana: Else I’ll miss all the important parts😪
 Meghana: I remember watching till 74 minutes
 Meghana: After that I don’t know what happened
 Varun: So basically you missed all the good stuff 😂
 Meghana: Yes yes😭😭the exciting part I missed. Should have just slept at 11 only😪
 Varun: Don't do that 🙈
 Varun: Done with work?
 Meghana: Just got done. Today was crazy😵
 Meghana: So there is this tonsillectomy procedure that I’ve been putting off for months
 Meghana: But then I thought I should just be done with it, because it scares me
 Meghana: Face the fear😂
 Meghana: So I asked my PM when he thought would be a good time for me to do it
 Meghana: Because of work stuff
 Meghana: He suggested I finish it before the ResHat calls resume
 Meghana: I had actually thought of getting the procedure done after my GRE next week
 Meghana: But the RedHat engagement will start again on 21st
 Meghana: So I went to my doctor at Apollo in the morning
 Meghana: Long story short, I’m getting the surgery done on Saturday 😂😵
 Varun: Ooff. Lots of information
 Varun: When's GRE?
 Meghana: 😂😂
 Meghana: I had scheduled for 16th of this month

 Varun: Normal day.. nothing interesting
 Varun: Why??
 Varun: I was going to wake you up if it went into penalties
 Meghana: Aye, Thenks🙈🙈yes yes yes
I fell asleep kind of early actually. So a call for interesting developments was a great idea🙈🙈
How was the match?
 Meghana: I don’t know why I’m awake now😮
 Meghana: I’m not sure why exactly 🤔
I sort of like directed all the focus to my sister’s. Hers is in July as well. 12 days after mine and she’s turning 18 this year

 Varun: Oh that's crazy 🙈
 Varun: That's when the match got over
 Meghana: Shit, that’s late😮😮

Don’t know why
 Meghana: Tomorrow morning is the procedure
 Meghana: Mostly at 7:30
 Meghana: The whole procedure will take around 4 hours I think. Surgery itself may be only like 1 hour
 Meghana: But the pre prep and post surgery n all will take some time it seems
 Varun: Mostly?
 Meghana: If people with emergencies suddenly come in they might have to postpone mine, but otherwise mine will be the first is what they told me
 Meghana: 👀👀
 Varun: Sorry sorry I was on one long call
 Varun: We were planning a drive tomorrow 🙈
 Varun: Friday was peace only

 Varun: I'll manage, I'll nap in the afternoon

 Meghana: 🤩🤩🤩
 Varun: He had some scar tissue so first week was a bit painful
 Varun: After that he became full fine
 Meghana: Aah this. This is what I’m slightly worried about. But knowing that everything will be okay 10 days from now makes it all so much better
 Meghana: I got my surgery gown 😂🤭

 Meghana: Yeah, I saw it and was shocked 
It is very revealing 😮
 Meghana: 😂😂damn, yeah?
 Meghana: Mine will be too loose also I think for me
 Meghana: Shit, will have to sit all the time😂
 Varun: As you might have realised I've spent some time in a hospital 😂
 Meghana: That too we aren’t supposed to wear anything else inside. Just the gown, damn, so weird😵
 Varun: I've broken bones a lot 😂
 Meghana: This was my next question
 Meghana: 😂
 Meghana: Oh shit
 Varun: Yeah 😂

 Varun: I was an adventurous child
 Meghana: Clearly 😂😂

 Varun: football , cricket, volleyball, jumping on sofa
 Meghana: Shit, where all did you break?😮
And you had to get surgeries done?😵😵😵

 Meghana: That must have been uncomfortable no😮
Leg or hand or both?
 Varun: Forearm , forearm, fingers, toe
 Varun: Hands only
 Meghana: Ayyo😮😮that’s a lot of places
 Varun: Toe was hairline it healed off ✌️
 Meghana: I’ve heard bone injuries are really painful
 Meghana: Hairline might be a breeze for you now no😂
 Varun: Once wrist also. But that was only bone bruise
 Varun: Nothing broke
 Meghana: Damn😵😵
 Varun: Forearm was a bad scene
 Varun: Hand shape only changed
 Meghana: How did it happen?
 Meghana: Shit shit
 Varun: Sofa and football
 Meghana: Both?
 Varun: Same bone same place
 Varun: 2 time 😂
 Meghana: Omg, that’s bad. Does it not hurt now?
 Meghana: 😵
 Meghana: Left or right?
 Varun: Nah .. this was in 1st grade
 Varun: Right
 Meghana: Ayyo😵😵
Shit, that’s a lot for a 1st standard kid. 😵
 Varun: That's when I learnt to write with my left hand
 Varun: Fun times 😂
 Meghana: Oh😮😂well, it was useful in some ways then
 Meghana: 😂😂😂fun times it seems
 Meghana: I have never really had injuries as such, touchwood
 Varun: I've troubled my parents a lot 🙈
 Meghana: But my sister used to keep getting stitches
 Varun: That also I've got 😂
 Varun: On my chin
 Meghana: I see that😂😂
These are really worrying for parents 😵😵
That too in first hand you got that forearm thing😵
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
You have had it all then da.
Shit😂
 Meghana: When was your last injury?
 Meghana: I hope the occurrences reduced as you grew up
 Varun: Haha 😂😂
 Varun: Last I think was football
 Meghana: For real 😂
 Varun: I sprained my wrist
 Meghana: Oh damn. When was this?
 Varun: I had to skip one game
 Varun: December ish
 Meghana: That’s very very recent 😂😂
I thought you’d say some two years back n all😂
 Varun: Oh no wait wait
 Varun: I fully fucked my thumb in March
 Varun: Cricket
 Meghana: Oh shit, must have been really hurtful.
When you caught the ball?
 Varun: It became swollen and purple. 😂
 Varun: One brinjal it became

 Varun: Yeah with keeping
 Meghana: Ayyo😮
 Varun: While"
 Meghana: How many days did it take for it to be normal again?
 Varun: 10 days
 Meghana: Shit, I can’t even imagine that pain
 Meghana: For small things only thumb chumma hurts sometimes
 Meghana: So this😵😵
 Varun: I think at this point I'm just used to it
 Meghana: 😂😂that’s okay too I guess
Hope you don’t have another injury or sprain or fracture.
 Varun: Thanks 🙈
 Varun: I'll try
 Varun: Have you met your surgeon?
 Meghana: Not today. I don’t think he’s here yet.🤔
 Meghana: At 7:30 they’ll take me it seems
 Meghana: The nurse just came and told
 Meghana: Don’t know when I’ll be able to meet the surgeon
 Meghana: I actually had first met a doctor at Bangalore
 Meghana: Some time ago
 Meghana: I wanted to get it done by her
 Varun: Oh
 Meghana: Then because of the logistics she referred me to him since he’s here only
 Varun: But this is good
 Varun: Your parents are there with you
 Varun: They will also be at peace
 Meghana: Parents are not giving me peace 😂
Dad went home last night because Abhi is alone at home. Mom stayed with me
 Meghana: Yeah, now they are I think
 Meghana: They keep asking me if I’m worried
 Meghana: And then I told them
 Varun: Paavam
 Varun: Let them be
 Meghana: That I’m very bold n all😂
And I usually smile a lot, so they know I’m okay
 Varun: I don't think we'll ever understand unless we are in their place
 Meghana: True, this I also thought . But this is a lot of worrying no😵
But I guess this sort of naturally comes
 Meghana: No matter how much we say we won’t be like them
 Meghana: I keep asking parents to be very selfish and think more about themselves
 Meghana: But they don’t 😑
 Varun: Generation gap 😂
 Meghana: I tell them also that they don’t have to feel guilty about this because I’m going to do this to my kids😂
 Meghana: Big one😂😂
But I’m sure we will all be like this eventually
 Meghana: When the time comes
 Meghana: But you know what I won’t like
 Meghana: My kids dating, I think I’ll get annoyed and possessive 😂😂
 Meghana: Especially if it’s a son
 Meghana: 😪😪😪😭😭
 Varun: I mean I will be a different parent to my child for sure. But that's not cause what my mom and dad is was wrong of anything.. just a different approach
 Varun: 😂😂
 Varun: This is going to be fun to watch 😂
 Meghana: Yeah, that yes, I keep telling parents also this all the time. But the worrying will always be there I guess
 Meghana: 😭😭it’s going to be very hurtful
 Meghana: I’m sure they’ll come home one day saying they’ve found one bitch😪
 Varun: Already soo judgemental 😂
 Varun: Give the girl a chance no 🙈
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂yes🤭
 Meghana: She has to be really good😪😪
I’ll think about this. But I just hope they don’t find anyone too soon
 Meghana: I feel really evil😂
 Meghana: But it’s okay🤭
 Meghana: I think if it’s a daughter she can date🤔
 Varun: Think about it like you are the girl and your boyfriend's mother doesn't give you a chance 😂
 Varun: Then you'll understand
 Meghana: 😮😮😮😮😮
 Varun: Why this gender bias
 Meghana: Oh damn, no no no no😮😮 that will be horrible . Shit.
But yes, I think I’ll also eventually come around, but it will be hard to accept initially 😪😪😪or maybe I’ll just gel with her really well
 Meghana: I don’t understand either😂😂😂
 Varun: In sure you'll eventually come around. It's just the initial emotion 😂
 Varun: Im *
 Meghana: Yes, I think after some time I’ll just get used to the fact. Until then I’ll just eat up my sorrow😪
 Varun: Eat up my sorrow itseems 🙈
 Varun: Go rant to your husband
 Meghana: Then what😪
 Meghana: He better sit and listen😂
 Varun: I guess by that point he'll be good at it
 Varun: 😂
 Meghana: Yes yes, he’ll be used to it by then😂 but I won’t do that annoying rant I think
 Meghana: He better find it cute, else I’m dead😂
 Varun: Hahaha 😂😂
 Varun: Do you switch language with you are really angry?
 Meghana: I do I do. Anything that affects me I speak about in English. As in at home, if I get emotional or if I’m angry I switch to English
 Meghana: You do too?
 Meghana: I usually speak in malayalam only to parents
 Varun: Depends who I'm angry with
 Varun: Yeah I speak in tamil only to mom and dad
 Meghana: 😂😂what are the different languages you switch to?
 Varun: If I'm angry with them one unique mixture is tamil and English will come
 Varun: Otherwise anger usually results in English
 Meghana: 😂😂😂this sounds fun and really cute
Only when angry or any kind of emotional state?
 Varun: Now my parents will get up and yell at me for being up. So I'm going to close my eyes, if I sleep I'll sleep or else ill wake up in 30mins and pretend I woke up early 🙈
 Varun: Any heightened emotion
 Meghana: 😂😂awww

Otherwise it’s quite okay. I slept all day but 🙈
 Varun: Sleep is the best way to recover fast
 Meghana: Yes 🤭 I feel a little useless but 😂
 Varun: It's ok to just rest for a while
 Varun: Don't need to always be usefull and productive

Because of this weather I keep getting these urges to cough. And coughing hurting
 Meghana: But over all it’s not bad, it’s day 4 already 🤩
 Meghana: How’s your day da?
 Varun: I tried to sleep at 1
 Varun: Somewhere before 3 I slept
 Varun: Ouch. I felt the pain. I used to get throat infections before, and that only hurt soo bad. Can't imagine this
 Varun: Yaas! You are doing great! It's going to be over soon and you can sing also if you want 🙈
 Meghana: Damn😮
But at least you slept, so not bad
 Meghana: I would have loved this weather if not for this😭
I’m actually scared the scabs will come off early because of coughing and bleeding will happen, so I’m trying not to cough
Like it’s the perfect stay in bed weather .
I think it’s not much worse than the throat infections 🤔
 Meghana: 🙈🙈yes, it will all be over soon🤭
But my voice is different now😮 does voice change after tonsillectomy 🤔
 Varun: Haha google this 🙈
 Varun: And let me know
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂yes, I’ll let you know.

 Varun: I won't know the difference 🙈
 Varun: So it's fine 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂 that’s there
 Meghana: My voice people say is sort of squeaky
 Meghana: Especially when I’m excited or in videos n all 😓
 Meghana: I used to get caught a lot at school because of that I think 🤔

Hope that gets fixed if voice is going to be changing😂

I look really ugly if it’s not a candid😂
 Meghana: Same same😂😪
 Varun: 😂😂😂😂
 Varun: Im not very photogenic
 Varun: I understand
 Meghana: Yes, so you feel me😂😂
This is why I ask people to take when I’m not looking
 Meghana: But that they don’t do😑
 Varun: Sometimes that also I'll look weird
 Meghana: Same😂😂😂😂😂
My God, yeah, I can look super weird in those also. Once in a while, very rarely I get lucky and get a pic
 Meghana: 😭
 Varun: I'll just stick to taking pictures
 Meghana: That’s the best actually. But then you won’t be in any of the pics no😮
 Meghana: That’s not nice either right
 Varun: I'll take that
 Meghana: But no memories no😮
 Varun: I'll remember using the pictures I took
 Varun: 🙈
 Varun: Of others
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂aye.. that works too, I guess😂
I take good pics, but my sister thinks I suck. I feel like she looks good in all pics😮
 Varun: Hahaha 😂😂
 Varun: They don't appreciate good pictures immediately
 Meghana: Yes😑 and then I have to sit and search for them
 Varun: It takes time
 Meghana: That’s there actually 😂😂
But I start hating my pics when I keep looking at them
 Meghana: Yesterday after I posted I kept looking and I felt very ugly suddenly 😂
 Varun: Hahaha I do that too 🙈
 Varun: You look just fine! Chumma drama
 Varun: (I went back and checked)
 Meghana: No no, for real😮I kept staring and I felt like deleting only😂
 Meghana: Oh😂😂so this is reliable information
 Varun: Yes
 Varun: Credible
 Meghana: Yes🤭
Oh wait, shit, but I swear I wasn’t fishing for compliments 😂
 Varun: I'll go get some dinner wait
 Varun: Chill 😂😂
 Meghana: Yes yes, oh shit, I feel like I read something about dinner in one of the previous messages. But I hadn’t read read. Now it hit😂

 Meghana: He had his own things to do
 Varun: Aww 🙈
 Varun: He'll eventually understand how lucky he is
 Meghana: 😂😂this is cute
He better do. He’s got too much attitude these days because of all the attention he gets from everyone
 Varun: He's young and naive
 Varun: That's why
 Meghana: 😂😂he is
Acting like a typical teenager
 Varun: 😂😂😂
 Meghana: I full on judge teenagers these days😂
 Varun: Why da
 Varun: You were one of them
 Meghana: I was not one of them😮
 Meghana: I was a nice teenager I think🤔
 Varun: Please explain
 Varun: This also
 Meghana: Teenagers these days act like they are 25😑
 Meghana: I was a very nice innocent teenager 😂
 Varun: What do they do? 😂
 Meghana: The way some of them act da😮
 Meghana: They are all like well kept n all😮
 Meghana: And the way they talk and act in general
 Meghana: 😮
 Meghana: And the kind of problems they have da😮
 Meghana: I’m jealous I think😂
 Meghana: I look homeless most of the times
 Varun: Homeless best!
 Varun: No expectation
 Meghana: 😂😂aye, I can clean okayishly well too I guess
 Meghana: ^clean up
 Meghana: 😂😂😂this is good but
 Varun: This is my logic with everything
 Meghana: It’s a wonderful logic. I try to be like this as well. But it’s hard to keep it that way
 Varun: If people don't expect from you.. everything is considered good 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂😂
So you like put down expectations fully ?
 Varun: Generally keep expectations low 🙈
 Varun: But always give 100%
 Meghana: Yeah?😮
 Meghana: Doing that is not easy😮
 Varun: You've to try no. If you don't try then you have only yourself to blame
 Meghana: Aah yes yes, I try n all
But to keep 0 expectations and give that much is hard right? 
As in, if that isn’t reciprocated even a little bit it’s hard right?
 Varun: Hmm.. I expect a lot of myself
 Varun: I make sure others don't expect too much
 Varun: So disappointment is limited to me 😂
 Meghana: From you?
 Meghana: For other people right?
 Varun: This requires more explanation. 😂
 Meghana: My cousin is calling me for shopping😟I’m trying to fight my temptation now
 Meghana: Yes😂😂
 Varun: I make sure others don't expect much of me so whatever I do they aren't disappointed.
But I expect a lot out of myself so I'm almost always disappointed (not good , but sometimes motivating)
 Meghana: Oh yeah, I actually can totally relate to the second part.
What are you expectations from yourself?
 Varun: Depends on what thing no? 😂
‎ Varun: ‎image omitted
 Meghana: Oh yeah, you look really mature in this😮😮 very convincing this is😂
Damn, you like a totally different person only.
 Meghana: 😂😂yeah it does

But didn’t like my dj😪
 Varun: Oh no why
 Varun: Dude I slept off
 Varun: I woke up now
 Varun: Hihi! I've just become the hinge boy you used to talk to now 🙈
 Meghana: Hey hey
 Meghana: the only hinge boy I used to talk to actually 👀
 Varun: And then stopped for some reason 🙈
 Varun: (which I still don't know/understand)
 Meghana: We vibed really really well. Had mentioned to Manasa also about you. Even the call with you was extremely easy. Everything was great. Had deleted Hinge and everything.
But I didn’t know what our equation was. You did mention you were shy when it came to girls.
But meanwhile something happened. So remember I told you about the guy who almost dated my cousin. The guy and I got quite close after that. And I didn’t know what was happening between us(you and I) and I didn’t want to lead on because the other guy and I started getting close. 
But I still keep telling Manasa how well we had connected
 Meghana: 😢😢
 Varun: That's fine. I mean we don't control what happens to us and when. 
You could have just told me, or asked me and I'd have told you where we stand. 
But it's cool, you let me know where you are right now and what you want to do. If you'd rather us not talk, that's also fine (will be a bit sad) but I respect that.
 Meghana: I wanted to ask you, but somehow the conversation never came up. So then I wondered what the equation was. 
No no, I’d love for us to talk. We connected very well. Communication gap came in the way.
But the other guy and I are very close. We are planning on dating and seeing how it goes.
 Varun: Understandable. I was just taking my time, given that you are back in Mysore and I'm here. But I'm glad you told me. ✌️
 Meghana: Yes, that I understand now. Shit. But since nothing on those lines came up in our conversations (my bad too, I should have brought it up) I thought it wasn’t happening.
So we won’t talk at all?
 Varun: That's alright.
 Varun: Ayy no, I'd really like to still talk to you, if you are ok with it ofc
 Meghana: Yes yes, I’d love it too🤩
I’d really love for us to still talk
 Varun: 😌
 Varun: Sure ✌️
 Varun: Happy onam da!
 Meghana: Thank you so much 🙈
And same to you da
 Meghana: Put a very big flower rangoli this time
 Varun: I went to grandmoms house and ate and slept 😂
 Meghana: 😂😂sadhya?
 Meghana: Even I ate too much 😮😮
 Meghana: Couldn’t move 😵
 Varun: Haha I took a solid 4 hr nap
 Meghana: 😂😂😂😂
 Meghana: That was the best thing to do the
 Meghana: *tbh
 Meghana: We tried watching a movie and all of us fell asleep
 Meghana: Then rewatched at night
 Varun: Haha, I was up a long while cause of that afternoon nap
